<section><title>&ipaq;</title>
<para>
To install &opie; on an &ipaq;, you will need a recent Familiar installation (i.e.
install the Familiar "bootstrap" image, and do not install task-complete or task-x),
go to http://familiar.handhelds.org to get the latest version, and to get installation
instructions (again, stop after the initial boot and do not install X, as it is not
necessary, and will only take up space).
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you had QPE/QTopia installed previously, <emphasis>completely</emphasis> remove
it, and then remove the source line for that feed from your /etc/ipkg.conf file before
attempting to install &opie;.
</para>
</note>
<para>
Once you have Familiar installed, set up a network connection between your &ipaq;
and the ouside world (again, see the Familiar site for instructions on this),
and then run this command:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     echo src opie "http://opie.handhelds.org/feed/ipaq/unstable/" \
          >> /etc/ipkg.conf
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
then, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update && ipkg install task-opie
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
If you have a 3100 or 3800 series &ipaq;, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg install libqt2-emb-fonts
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
finally, start &opie; with:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     /etc/init.d/opie start
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
&opie; should now be running (if you should have to reboot, which is rare, &opie;
will start automatically). From here, you can use either the "Packages"
application in the Settings tab, or run ipkg from the command line to install
other &opie; applications. Check out the various task-opie-* packages to install
various sets of applications all at once (you can always uninstall individual
applications individually). You will probably want to install opie-embeddedkonsole
or opie-console first, so you have access to the command line in &opie;.

<section><title>&zaurus;</title>
<para>
&opie; applications will install and run on the default &zaurus; ROM with no problems,
except for Launcher. It is not compatible with the default ROM, and should not be
installed.
</para>

<para>
Another option is to replace the default &zaurus; ROM with the OpenZaurus
ROM. OpenZaurus is a openly developed Linux distribution designed to run on the
&zaurus;, and uses &opie; as its default user interface. For more information and
installation instructions, please visit their site, http://www.openzaurus.org/.

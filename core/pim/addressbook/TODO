Stuff todo until OPIE 1.0 :

Pending bugfixes from previous work:

Urgent:

- Font menu is invisible using german translation

Important:

- Overview window cleanup needed..
- Cursor keys should work in detail-view (ablabel)
- "What's this" should be added
- Store last settings of combo-boxes
- Finishing of new View functions (List, Phonebook...)
- The names of the countries are sorted by there english names, only..
  Even if they are translated.. :S
- Reload if contacts were changed externally

Less important:

-  The picker (alphabetical sort widget) should be
   placed verticaly or horizontally (configurable)
- Use advanced database functions in abtable to decrease
  memory footprint and to make everything more easy !
	(abtable should store Iterator for selected Category)

Should be Fixed (not absolute sure, need further validation):
- "Nonenglish" translation bug has to be fixed.

Fixed:
- Syncing: abtable not reloaded after sync.
- Find widget should be replaced by something like 
  qpdf has.
- Adding a configuration dialog
- Picker: Activated letter schould be more visible
- Advanced handling of cursor keys (search..)
- Mail-Icon is missing
- Use opie-mail insted of qt-mail if possible.

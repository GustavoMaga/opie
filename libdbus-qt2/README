This is a backport to Qt2 of Kevin Krammer's backport to Qt3 of Harald
Fernengel's Qt4 D-Bus bindings.

Some Qt4 based code had no direct equivalent in Qt3 (or Qt2). Cases where
this transition to Qt3 might not be fully correct are marked with FIXME-QT4

Depending on the use case it might be necessary to extend QDBusMesssage
to allow marshalling/de-marshalling based on an application provided
helper as the Qt2 QVariant can not handle all cases the Qt4 pendant can
(user defined types, etc)

In order to build, run the following:

qmake
make

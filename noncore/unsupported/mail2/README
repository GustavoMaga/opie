Mail README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!! !! !! !! !!
This program does not yet work. You can send email, but IMAP inbox viewing
isn't posible due some bugs. Please don't complain. If you want to send mail,
look for another program (Which does not exist yet.)

About:
Mail is divided into three parts: libmail, mail and bend.
libmail is a library containing all classes needed both by mail and
bend. This includes for example the IMAP classes, the plugin structure, and
configfile management.
mail is the mailer itself. You could say it is a gui to libmail.
bend is the messagenotifier tool. It runs as an applet in the Opie taskbar.

Compilation:
To compile, you have to set $QTDIR and $TMAKEPATH to the appropriate
directories. Then simply make in the toplevel directory of the distribution.

Have fun, Constantin <cbergemann@lisa.de>.

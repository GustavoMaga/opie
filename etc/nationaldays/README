Config files for the nationalholiday plugin

Format is simple:
Standard-xml file. 
It must always enclosed by
<nationaldays>
...
</nationaldays>

then a short description tag.
<description value="german holidays"/>

for example. It should be used later on.

then a list of holidays follows, encapsulated with 
<entries>
...
</entries>

A non-floating holiday entry has the form 
<entry date="M-D" name="description of holiday"/>

floating holidays:
<entry name="<name>" type="floating">
<calculation>
 ... calc entries ..
</calculation>
</entry>

The calcentries may following tags:

date - a short date (without Year!) in form M-D or the string "easter"
offset - integer. these days will added (or substracted) after all other calcs are made.
weekday - the day of week as monday, tuesday and so on.
dayofmoth - in combination with weekday you can say "first <weekday> of ..." or "second <weekday> of ..."

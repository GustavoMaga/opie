<chapter><title>Software</title>

<para>
The "Software" application, also called oipkg, is what is used to install and
remove software.  It is actually a frontend to the command line program "ipkg"
so most things you can do with oipkg you can also do with ipkg.  Oipkg can
install things either remotely from a web server (called a "feed") or it can
install an ipkg package file that resides on the local filesystem.
</para>
<important>
<para>
There is a bug in oipkg that prevents it from installing packages
properly.  There is, however, a workaround for it.  Simply run oipkg from
Embedded Konsole to avoid the bug.

<section><title>Installing Software</title>
<para>
To install software, first select "Opie" from the "Section" pulldown menu,
the press the "+" icon next to "Feeds" in the main view.  This will show all
the available Opie packages (you can change which packages to view by selecting
something else from the "Section" pulldown).  Installed packages are marked
with a blue circle, while packages that are not installed are marked with a red
box.  If you click on the icon for an uninstalled package, it will turn into an
open box, with a blue circle coming out of it, indicating that you have marked
this package to be installed.  Mark as many packages as you wish this way, and
then press the "Apply" icon (same red box and blue dot icon) to install all
the marked packages.  It will also remove any packages marked for removal (see
below).  Clicking this will open a window showing all the packages marked to be
removed and installed, with some check boxes on the bottom, which represent
arguments to be sent to ipkg, which you can usually ignore.  After verifying
that all the packages to be installed are correct, press "Ok" in the upper
right corner (or press "x" to cancel and go back to the package selection
window).  The packages should then install, and you should see their icons
appear in the Launcher, if they are Opie applications.

<section><title>Removing Software</title>
<para>
Removing software is the same as installing software, except you will press the
blue circle icon of an installed package, and it will have a red "X" over it.  
Then press the apply icon, and "Ok".  You can install and remove packages at
the same time by marking the ones you want to install and the ones you want to 
remove, and then pressing apply.

<section><title>Destinations</title>
<para>
Software is distributed in a format called "ipkg" which contains all the 
necessary files for the program, as well as information on where to put them.  
However, this information is only half complete, as it tells the package manager 
where in the "destination" to put the files, but the package manager must know 
where this "destination" is.  The default destination is "/" (called "root") so
if the package says to install a file in opt/QtPalmtop/ then the file will be
installed in /opt/QtPalmtop/.  However, if ask the package manger to use a
destination at /mnt/hda/ (this is typically where a compact flash card would be)
then the files will be installed in /mnt/hda/opt/QtPalmtop/.
</para>
<para>
The problem with installing file in a destination other than root is that the 
software usually does not know where to fine the installed files, and Opie does 
not know where to find the information that tells it how to display the program 
in the Launcher.  To get around this, the package manager creates links 
<footnote><para>See <xref linkend=symlink> for more information on symbolic 
links in Linux</para></footnote> from where the files would be if they were 
installed in root to where they are actually installed.  This means that no more 
space is taken up where the files would normally be installed, but any programs
can still find the files where they think they should be.
</para>

<section><title>Using Destinations</title>
<para>
To install a package in a destination other than root, go to 
Settings&arrow;Setups to open the settings dialog to the Setups tab.  From here
you can select the destination you would like to install the package to from the 
pulldown menu at the bottom.  You will also want to check "Link to root 
destination" so that links are properly made.  Once you have selected the 
destination you want to install the package to, click the dialog's "Ok" button, 
and all packages that you install will be installed to the destination you 
selected.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Adding Destinations</title>
<para>
To add a destination, go to Settings&arrow;Destinations to bring up the settings 
dialog at the Destinations tab, and press the "New" button to add a new 
Destination to the list.  The new destination should be highlighted 
automatically, and you can then change the name and the URL with the two text 
entry fields below it.  The name is only for easy display of the destination, so 
name it whatever makes the most sense to you.  The URL is the location that you 
want the destination to have.  So, if you want all your software to be installed 
under /usr/directory then you would set the URL to that.  You can then click 
"Ok" to save, or "x" to cancel the changes.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Editing Destinations</title>
<para>
You can edit a destination by going to Settings&arrow;Destinations and selecting 
the destination that you would like to edit.  Then you can edit the Name and URL 
fields in the same manner as when you added a destination.  To save, click "Ok" 
or cancel by clicking "x".
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Deleting Destinations</title>
<para>
Deleting a destination is very easy.  Go to Settings&arrow;Destinations and 
select the Destination that you would like to delete in the dialog that appears. 
 Press the "Remove" button to delete the destination, and press "Ok" to save the 
changes, or "x" to cancel them.

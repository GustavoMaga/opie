    <h1>Profile Editing</h1>
    <p>There are two ways to create a Connection, either using 'New Connection'
       ( <img src="new.png"> ) or to use a previously saved profile.
      Both ways involve the usage of the Profile Dialog.<br>
      <p>The Profile Editor dialog is divided into four tabs, 
      <a href="#profile">Profile</a>, <a href="#connection">Connection</a>, 
      <a href="#terminal">Terminal</a> and <a href="#keys">Special Keys</a>.<br>

      <P><B><a name="profile">Profile</a></b> - In Profile you need to set a
      Profile name and select a connection type. So far, opie-console supports
      a 'local console', a Serial and a Modem connection type. You may also
      choose for this profile to auto connect after loading by checking the box
      at the bottom.<br>

      <P><B><a name="connection">Connection</a></b>  - According to the type of
      connection you selected in the previous tab, the options here will vary.
      For local console there is no option available.
      Modem and Serial share most of the configuration. You can select
      a device to use, the speed, the flow control and the parity. On top
      of that Modem let's you choose a number to dial and  to configure
      a set of AT commands.<br>

      <P><B><a name="terminal">Terminal</a></b> - The Terminal Tab lets you
      choose a Terminal Type, a color scheme, and the font size.<br><p>
      
      <b><a name="keys">Special Keys</a></b> - The fourth tab is there to
      customize the drop-down software keyboard for each profile. You can
      select how many rows and columns you want on your keyboard. To edit a
      key, tap on the key and select a label, enter the Q Keycode and the
      Unicode Value. Click <a href="opie-console/fkeyboard.html">here</a> for
      more information about these values.

      <br>
      <P>Clicking the OK button on the top right corner saves this profile
      and loads the profile for use.

      
      <!-- this shoudlnt really go here....

      <h2>Using the Profile Editor</h2>
      <p>The Configuration Dialog can be accessed by either clicking
      on the 'Connection' Menu and then 'Configure Profiles' or by the
      item in the <a href="opie-console/menubar.html">menu bar</a>.<br>
      <p>The list view contains the already saved profiles. You can add
      , remove and modify profiles by selecting one and clicking the
      appropriate button.<br>

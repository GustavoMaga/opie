\section{GUI Classes}

\subsubsection{Recurrence Widget}
Opie PIM offers a recurrence Widget to let the user
configure the recurrence.

\subsubsection{Mainwindow}
The mainwindow implements a QCOP Interface for showing, 
editing records. It can handle alarms and reminder activation.

\section{Cross Reference}

\subsection{The idea}
Sometimes an Event or Todo is related to something else. 
For example the Birthday Attribute of your children Record relate
to the Birthday Event in your Datebook and the ``Book clown''
in your Todolist.\\
We need a way to select the Record and the attribute if we want
that fine grained information.

\subsection{Selecting the Reference}
\subsubsection{Out Of Process Selection}
For an Out of Process solution we could utilize the targeted
Application to request the selection of an record.\\
For that to work we need to know which application offers
Cross Referencing and the API needs to be able to find the
application and then call them via QCOP.\\
Later for resolving the Cross Reference the same application\\
would be either asked to give a summary string or it could
display the reference on demand. This requires the application
to start and a specific selection window, but more easily
allows to cross reference attributes.

\subsubsection{In Process Selection}
In Process Selection is possible with the usage of OPimBase 
and OPimRecord. It allows to query and sort in a generic way.
This would allow to have a generic Selector widget which
can be used to select a Record and possible files as well. To
support new types one could dlopen the Frontends to allow
custom Frontends.

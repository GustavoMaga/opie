 * Abstract class for dealing with PIM database change logging
 *
 * A change log is an optional part of a backend. If implemented it stores
 * entries tracking changes to the data (adds, updates, deletes).
 * It also holds a separate list of peers it has synced with and when
 * they last synced (so that (a) we can filter for changes since each
 * peer last synced, and (b) we can know when it's safe to delete entries
 * that are no longer needed by any peer.) Also provided is a way to find
 * out when a peer last synced and remove a peer so that log entries only
 * useful to an "old" peer can be removed.

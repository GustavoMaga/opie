Opie Phase is based on the style from David Johnson
and was backported to Qt2 by Holger Hans Peter Freyther



Original PHASE 0.4 README


Phase, Version 0.x
==================

Phase is a look and feel for KDE. It is designed to be functional but not drab
and aesthetic but not distracting. Artistic design draws upon the genius of
earlier masters. This is particularly true for minimalistic designs. Therefore
I cannot in good conscience claim this look to be truly original. But I have
done my best.

The Phase widget style is built as a KDE plugin, but is also useful for
standalone Qt programs provided that the KDE libraries are installed. Please
read the INSTALL file for installation instructions. You can activate the
style through the KDE Control Center.

Please note that Phase requires KDE 3.x and above. It will not build or run
under earlier versions of KDE. Full functionality requires KDE 3.2 or greater.
The Phase homepage is at <http://www.usermode.org/code.html>.

I had problems with a swapped x/y axis when I moved to libts and calibrated
using opie-calibrate.

When I uses ts_calibrate from tslib-tools, the x/y-axis were correct.

So I used tslib-tools' ts_calibate.c as a template to write a newer opie-calibrate
tools. It works for me so far, now it would be helpful to find out if it works
for other devices equally well.

CAVEAT: in Qt/E src/kernel/qwsmouse_qws.cpp there is no direct access to
the a,b,c d,e,f and s variables, not even via readCalibration() because their're
protected. So you basically have to restart Opie after calibrating, which I'm
doing (yet).

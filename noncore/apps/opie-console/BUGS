Ok we all know we write perfect code
but sometimes the compiler produces bad code
and we need to work around some compiler bugs!! -zecke


Send/receive: lrzsz behaves strange when trying to use
--overwrite or --rename.

- console should autoconnect by default

- keys and buttonbar merge

- keys really working

- scripting with "direct subpopup"

- kill more compiler warnings.

- more colorshemes ( "orange is ugly" )

- irda and bluetooth out ( can be done with normal serial as long as the
connection is allready up, and extended stuff is a lot of work; maybe later
in again ).

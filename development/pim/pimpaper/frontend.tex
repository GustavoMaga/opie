\subsection{Low Level Frontend}
OPimBase is a low level not value based interface, to do basic queries
and record finding in a generic way. It is present to allow
generic access to all Frontends.

\subsection{OTemplateBase}
Inherits from OPimBase and implements bits of the OPimBase Interface.
This class is present to be used by the Backends ( OPimAccessBackend )
to set cache sizes and to cache items.

\subsection{OPimAccessTemplate}
Implements OTemplateBase and OPimBase. All low level functions are
automatically implemented by the OPimAccessTemplate which does
additional type checking based on OPimRecord::rtti.\\
This template is value based and utilizes the Backend. The Backend
can be set on the Constructor, when no Backend is specified
the default Backend Implementation will be used.
This AccessTemplate operates on OPimRecord based types and is meant
to be used by concrete Frontend implementations for Todo, Event,
Note and Address. The concrete Frontends can be used by applications.
Use this template to create your own PIM Type.

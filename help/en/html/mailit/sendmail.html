lets you add arbitrary <a href=mailit/attachments.html>attachments </a> to the mail, the OK button puts the mail created into the outbox ready to send later.
<br>
If there is required information missing a dialog box will remind you to complete the email.<br>
The listbox to the left lets you switch between the recipients (<I>To:</I>)and the carbon copy (<I>CC:</I>) entry of the address field in the middle.<br>
To the right of this field there is a button which opens an addressbook picker to pick one or more email addresses from the Opie addressbook.

The address field is filled depending whether the <I>To:</I> or <I>CC:</I> entry is active.<p>

Release Notes for Opie-ALPHA Version February 2002
----------------------------------------------------

=====================
=  Supported Devices  =
=====================

- HERMES chipset [ orinoco ], e.g. Lucent/Agere cards
- PRISM2 chipset [ orinoco or hostap ], e.g. D-Link, Buffallo
- SYMBOL/SPECTRUM chipset* [ orinoco ], e.g. Symbol Spectrum 24, Socket Lowpower CF
- CISCO chipset

* Warning: Current Symbol/Spectrum CF drivers have bugs - they freeze the system in monitor mode.
           This has nothing todo with Wellenreiter as its a driver problem.

=====================
=        Build        =
=====================

(I) Opie Build Environment

To compile Wellenreiter within the Opie build environment, do
'make menuconfig' and check Wellenreiter in the subsection
"Communications and Networking"

do 'make SUBDIRS=noncore/net/wellenreiter' or 'make' (to build everything)
Note that you need to have libpcap in your toolchain.

(II) OpenZaurus Build Environment

See (I), but do 'make SUBDIRS=packages/opie'

(III) To compile a standalone Wellenreiter for X11, you need Qt3 and the development
packages for Qt3, e.g. libqt3-devel. Assuming, $QTDIR is set to your Qt-Director
(e.g. /usr/lib/qt3), set $OPIEDIR to your installation prefix, e.g. /usr/local, then
'export QMAKESPEC=$QTDIR/mkspecs/linux-g++'
'qmake "platform=x11" wellenreiter.pro'
'make'
'make install'

=====================
=     Install       =
=====================

Alternatively, you can use our precompiled ipk. Get it from
http://opie.net.wox.org/wellenreiter/. There is also a recent libpcap available.

=====================
=       Run         =
=====================

There are two possible modes: <Manual> and <Automatic>. I suggest, you
start with the <Automatic> Mode. This works just using the Start/Stop
Toolbutton in the Wellenreiter Menubar. Note that you need to configure
your card before the Start/Stop-Toolbutton can be clicked.

If this doesn't work, then try calling the wellenreiter daemon
[wellenreiterd] manually. It has a command line interface. You can
start the GUI before or after the daemon.

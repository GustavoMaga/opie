Stuff todo:

Urgent:

- Font menu is invisible using german translation

Important:

- Finishing of new View functions (List, Phonebook...)
- Reload if contacts were changed externally
- "What's this" should be added
- The names of the countries are sorted by there english names, only..
  Even if they are translated.. :S
- Store last settings of combo-boxes
- Mail-Icon is missing

Less important:

- Find widget should be replaced by something like 
  qpdf has.
-  The picker (alphabetical sort widget) should be
   placed verticaly or horizontally (configurable)
- Use advanced database functions in abtable to decrease
  memory footprint and to make everything more easy !
	(abtable should store Iterator for selected Category)

Should be Fixed (not absolute sure, need validation):
- "Nonenglish" translation bug has to be fixed.

Fixed:
- Syncing: abtable not reloaded after sync.

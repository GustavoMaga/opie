  <note>
    <para>The <xref linkend="installation" endterm="tinstallation"> chapter and some other chapters of this manual have been updated in August 2003, especially to take into account <ulink url="http://opie.handhelds.org/archive_2003-w31.html">&opie; 1.0 release</ulink>. But it is difficult for the &opie; team to keep up with &opie; and &opie; applications progress. Please indulge this manual occasional tardiness!</para>
    <para>Please note, also, that the end of this guide (from late Chapter 2 on) is incomplete, when it comes to documenting applications. In particular, the following applications still have an empty page:
      <emphasis>appearance2,
      appskey,
      calibrate,
      citytime,
      drawpad,
      handwriting,
      helpbrowser,
      kjumpx,
      language,
      lightpower,
      login,
      multikey,
      pickboard,
      player2,
      qpdf,
      reader,
      rotation,
      sheet,
      showimg,
      sshkeys,
      sysinfo,
      tableviewer,</emphasis>
      and <emphasis>write</emphasis>. Hopefully their interface is clear enough so you won't need documentation so much :-)

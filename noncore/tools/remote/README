opie-remote

Opie-remote is a remote control emulator for the Compaq iPaq and the Sharp 
Zaurus. It requires lirc (http://www.lirc.org) to run. There are lirc ipkgs 
for the iPaq in the Handhelds.org feed. You must first install the
lirc-modules-[kernel version] ipkg, and then the lirc ipkg with the
-force-depends option. The Zaurus is supported, but requires you to compile 
from lirc's CVS. Zaurus support should be in lirc 0.6.6 and up. Check the learn
tab in opie-remote for more detailed configuration and usage instructions.

I will talk to the Open Zaurus people about providing an lirc ipkg for the
Zaurus, but i cant make one, as i dont have a Zaurus, and cannot test it.

todo:
add a frontend for irrecord (to make it a true learning remote)
make the UI completely user configurable (button layout, position, etc)
ButtonDialog needs to support default remote and button settings, so what the
button is already set to shows up.
fix any bugs

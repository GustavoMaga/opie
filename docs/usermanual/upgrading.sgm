First, you should shutdown &opie; from the "Shutdown" app in the Settings tab.
Normally, simply running
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update && ipkg upgrade
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
will upgrade &opie;. However, if you currently have a version with the 1.5.0
version number, you will have to upgrade it differently, because &opie; now uses a
different version number (the 1.5.0 was Qtopia's version number, we now use our
own). To upgrade from one of these older versions, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update
     ipkg install opie-update
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
&opie; should then be upgraded.

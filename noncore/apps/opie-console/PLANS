can we please get a working serial connection for now? if that works
i can test file transfers and stuff. -hash

From a UNIX point of view we want to do something like minicom
with a better GUI.
It should feature some terminal emulation vt100/102, ansi,
filetransfer via {x,y,z}modem, and some sort of session management.
Besides this requirement we would like to be able to execute 'scripts'
in a session.
A script would just write to the TEmulation and then be sent via
an IOlayer.
Then we would like to send keys? Do we want that?

We want a modular architecture which might support plugins in
the future

AndyQ - Fixed a bug in wlanimp.cpp : accept method - put braces round key 
        field if so that settings get saved if WEP is enabled

CLEAN UP

udchcp needs to output the dhcp information so interfaces can read it

interfacesetupimp really doesn't need a interface* pointer

Possible other modules to write: ppp, ipsec, bluetooth, ipchains

PPP module needs to scan pppd.tdb to see what is currently active

WLAN - add possiblity to input text or hex without knowing "s:"

Interface setupimp needs to use kernel calls.

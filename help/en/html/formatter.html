is a disk formatting front end. You can also perform disk fixing
operations.<br>
It does not use fdisk. It does not perform partioning. <br>If you are
going to reformat anything to another filesystem, I recommend running
fdisk and toggling the partition type, and reboot prior to formatting.
<br>
It scans all available disks, and filesystem supported.
<h2>On the Main tab</h2>
You select which disk to format, and select which file system to
format it too, push the format button, and hope it works. ;)<br>Please
back up any important data <b>before</b> you format it.
<h2>On the Advanced tab</h2> 
You can edit fdisk in textedit, or change the mount point with the
mount point edit box.<br>
When you select which dev, you will see fiole system infos, Type of
disk, what it is formatted with.
<br>It also shows the total space, used
space, and space available on the selected device.

<P>Pushing the check disk button will perform a file system check, and
output so you can see the changes it performs.
<P><h1>Please backup any important data before you use this program!</h1>

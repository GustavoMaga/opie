<h1>Opierec</h1>
<h4>
Opierec</h4> is a simple voice recording and audio sampling application for embedded devices.<P>
Opierec is easy to use, and can record just by pushing your PDA's
<B>toggle</B> switch, or by clicking on Opierec's
<B>Rec</B> button.<BR>
It can be used for voice memos, or CD quality audio sampling.
<P>
You first need to configure where you want your file to be recorded at,
depending on what's available CF, or SD cards. The default is
recording to your devices main memory. You
can record wave files using Intel/DVI ADPCM compression format, so they won't take so much space on your device. You will need to
choose your default recording length, but can always stop recording by
hitting the <B>toggle</B> button, or the <B>Stop</B> button.
<P>You can delete, rename, beam (via Ir, if available), or play files by holding the stylus down on
the selected file in the file view.
<P>You can also 'scroll' through a file by either grabbing the slider,
or by using the <B>Forward</B> or <B>Backward</B> buttons, or the
<B>right</B> and <B>left toggle</B> button.
<P>On the Configuration tab, you have a choice between sampling rates,
bit rates ( disabled when using compressed wave), size limit in
seconds, and file destination media. You are also able to adjust the
sound's input and output levels, or quickly mute either.
<P><P>
Opierec's audio files are compatible with desktop audio editors
and players.

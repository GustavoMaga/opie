<chapter><title>VNC Viewer</title>
<para>
The OPIE VNC Viewer allows you to connect to servers that are compatible with
the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol, most commonly used by the VNC remote 
access software.

<section><title>Adding a bookmark</title>
<para>
To add a new bookmark to your bookmark list, lick the New icon on the 
window's toolbar. The "VNC Viewer Connection" dialog will appear. Enter the 
hostname or IP address of the computer you would like to connect to in the 
"Host Name" field. In the "Display Number" field, enter the number of the 
display you would like to connect to. If you are connecting to a Windows or 
Mac OS server, you typically select display 0. Unix servers typically use
display 1 or higher. You must also enter the password for the server you 
would like to connect to if it requires one. If you are having difficulties
entering the password, you can select "Show Password" to show the password 
you are entering. You must also add a descriptive name for the bookmark if
you would like it to be saved. You can then either select the OK button to
save the bookmark and connect to the server, or the cancel button to return 
to the bookmark list.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Connecting to a bookmarked server</title>
<para>
To connect to a server that has already been bookmarked, select the bookmark 
from the list and press the "Open" icon on the toolbar.  The "VNC Viewer
Connection" dialog will appear, and you will have the chance to modify the 
bookmark before actually connecting. Pressing the OK button will connect to
the server, and pressing the cancel button will return to the bookmark list.
</para>

<section><title>Deleting a bookmark</title>
<para>
To delete a bookmark, choose the bookmark that you would like to delete, and 
select the delete item from the toolbar. 
</para>

<section><title>Advanced Connection Options</title>
<para>
In addition to the display number, hostname, and password, you can choose many 
advanced options from the "VNC Viewer Connection" dialog box that will affect
the performance of the connection.
</para>
<para> 
On the options tab you can set the delay in between requesting updates to the 
screen, a higher value will result in a more up to date screen, but you will 
use more bandwidth. You can also choose to restrict your connection to 8 bit 
color, which is much faster than using the color depth of the remote server 
at the cost of image quality. Requesting a shared session tells the RFB server
that you are willing to let other users connect at the same time.  You can use
the scaling factor on fit more of the remote screen into the space available on
your PDA, if you are willing to accept the performance hit involved in the 
scaling.
</para>
<para> 
The Encodings tab allows you to select which of the supported encodings you would
would like the VNC Viewer to use to communicate with the remote server. In most 
cases you don't need to modify anything on this tab.

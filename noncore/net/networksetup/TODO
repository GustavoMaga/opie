CLEAN UP

Write a class that parses /proc and not ifconfig

udchcp needs to output the dhcp information so interfaces can read it

interfacesetupimp really doesn't need a interface* pointer

Possible other modules to write: ppp, ipsec, bluetooth, ipchains

PPP module needs to scan pppd.tdb to see what is currently active

WLAN - add possiblity to input text or hex without knowing "s:"

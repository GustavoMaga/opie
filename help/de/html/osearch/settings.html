<h1>OSearch: Settings</h1>
Settings in OSearch will affect only the last search, the current searches will <b>not</b> be repeated.
<h2>Settings Menu</h2>
<h3>Search</h3>
<b>Case sensitive</b><br>
Should the searches be case sensitive.
<b>Use wildcards</b><br>
From the QT docu:<br>
... makes it convenient to match filenames instead of plain text. 
<br>
For example, "qr*.cpp" matches the string "qregexp.cpp" in wildcard mode, but not "qicpp" (which would be matched in normal mode).

Searches the content of text files too.

Should task which are allready compelted be hidden.
<h3>Datebook</h3>

- add possibility to input username and password ;)
- impl. PPPData::copyaccount & PPPData::deleteAccount
- update modem attribute inputs when modem has changed
- fix layout of edit account, i.e. get it shown maximised
- popup configure modem with the correct account prselected
	not quite shure why it does not work... IMHO it should work

/*
   Arabic shaping obeys a number of rules according to the joining classes (see Unicode book, section on
   arabic).

   Each unicode char has a joining class (right, dual (left&right), center (joincausing) or transparent).
   transparent joining is not encoded in QChar::joining(), but applies to all combining marks and format marks.

   Right join-causing: dual + center
   Left join-causing: dual + right + center

   Rules are as follows (for a string already in visual order, as we have it here):

   R1 Transparent characters do not affect joining behaviour.
   R2 A right joining character, that has a right join-causing char on the right will get form XRight
   (R3 A left joining character, that has a left join-causing char on the left will get form XLeft)
   Note: the above rule is meaningless, as there are no pure left joining characters defined in Unicode
   R4 A dual joining character, that has a left join-causing char on the left and a right join-causing char on
	     the right will get form XMedial
   R5  A dual joining character, that has a right join causing char on the right, and no left join causing char on the left
	 will get form XRight
   R6 A dual joining character, that has a  left join causing char on the left, and no right join causing char on the right
	 will get form XLeft
   R7 Otherwise the character will get form XIsolated

   Additionally we have to do the minimal ligature support for lam-alef ligatures:

   L1 Transparent characters do not affect ligature behaviour.
   L2 Any sequence of Alef(XRight) + Lam(XMedial) will form the ligature Alef.Lam(XLeft)
   L3 Any sequence of Alef(XRight) + Lam(XLeft) will form the ligature Alef.Lam(XIsolated)

   The two functions defined in this class do shaping in visual and logical order. For logical order just replace right with
   previous and left with next in the above rules ;-)

/*
  Two small helper functions for arabic shaping. They get the next shape causing character on either
  side of the char in question. Implements rule R1.

  leftChar() returns true if the char to the left is a left join-causing char
  rightChar() returns true if the char to the right is a right join-causing char

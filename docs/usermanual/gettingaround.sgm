<chapter><title>Using &opie;</title>
<para>
Now that &opie; is installed and running, it's time to start using it.  When you
first start &opie;, you will see the "Launcher" from which you can start all of
your Applications, and the "Taskbar" along the bottom, where you can see all
the running applications, select an input method, and interact with the
installed "applets".
</para>

<section><title>Getting Around</title>
<para>
Getting around in &opie; is very easy, you simply click your stylus on whatever
icon or button you want to click on.  The main difference between using the
stylus and using a mouse is that you cannot right click with a stylus, so things
that require a right click are kept to a minimum.  However, it is sometimes
necessary to right click, and this is implemented with a "press and hold".
Any time you want to do something that you think would require a right click on
a normal pc, try pressing the stylus down and holding it still for a few
seconds.  This usually opens up a context sensative menu, much like a right
click usually does on a desktop interface.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Launcher</title>
<para>
The Launcher behaves like the "desktop" on most PC GUIs.  When no applications
are running or visible, you will have access to the Launcher.  You can also map
a hardware key to bring the Launcher to the top without closing any of the
running applications (this is similar to "minimising" all the applications
that are running).
</para>
<para>
Along the top of the Launcher you will see a list of tabs which function as
categories for your applications.  You can click on the tab for the category you
want to view, and then click on the icon for the application that you wish to
launch.  By default, there will be an Applications tab and a Settings tab (if
you install any games, they will appear in the Games tab).  When new 
applications are installed, they will usually appear in one of these three tabs,
or in a tab of their own.  To add or delete tabs or to move applications between
the tabs, you can use the Tab Manager application, or you can edit them by hand,
by changing the directories in /opt/QtPalmtop/apps.
</para>
<para>
There is also a tab to the far right called the "Documents" tab, which allows 
you to quickly open your most often used documents.  You can click on a document
to open it up in the proper application.  For help on adding files to the
Documents tab see the <xref linkend="adddoc">.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Taskbar</title>
<para>
&opie; has a "Taskbar" that always runs along the bottom of the screen in &opie;,
except for a few "fullscreen" applications that cover it up.  The Taskbar is
what lets you select which input method you would like to use, shows what
applications are running, and is also where the "applets" draw their icons.
On the left of the Taskbar is an "O" button that opens a menu which has an
entry for every tab in the Launcher, allowing you to star an applications
without going back to the Launcher, or quiting the application that you are
running.  On the right hand side of the Taskbar, you will probably see a clock 
(unless you installed task-opie-minimal), which is actually just another applet
that draws the time instead of an icon.
</para>
<para>
When an application is run, it adds its icon to the Taskbar, starting from the
right side of the input method icon, with new application's icons appearing to
the right.  If you click on the icon for an application, it will be brought to 
the screen, allowing you to interact with it.
</para>
<para>
To the right of the "O" menu you will see an icon for the currently selected 
input method.  Clicking this will bring up the input method, allowing you to
type into the currently running application.  To the right of the input method
icon is a small arrow pointing up, which will open a menu of all the currently
installed input methods when clicked.  When you select one of these, it will
become the current input method, with its icon replacing the previous one.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Dialogs</title>
<para>
In &opie;, dialogs, as well as some applications, have a button labeled "Ok" on
the right side of the window title bar, in addition to the normal "x".  For 
dialogs, the "Ok" button will apply your changes and close the window, while
the "x" will cancel them before closing the window (for people used to most
desktop GUI's the "Ok" and "x" behave like the "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons
you would normally see in the bottom right of the dialog window).
</para>
<para>
For applications that have an "Ok" button as well as the "x" button that all
applications have, the "Ok" button will usually save the current file and then
close the application, while the "x" button will close the application without
saving.

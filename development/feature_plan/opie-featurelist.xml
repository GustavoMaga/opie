Copied from KDE and (C) by Cornelius Schumacher

This file serves as central repository of planned KDE features. It's parsed by
the PHP scripts in "opie-features.inc" which are used by "kde-3.2-features.html" to
generate HTML versions for the web.

If you plan to add a feature to KDE please add it to this file. A feature can
have one of three status types: "todo", "inprogress", "done". Please update
the status from time to time. For a release there shouldn't be any features
with other states than "done". If you can't complete a feature for a release
please move the feature to the next release. The "target" attribute specifies
for which release the feature should be finished. At the moment only the value
"3.2" is evaluated, but we will add pages showing the features for later
versions as needed.

Each feature consists of a summary giving a short description what the feature is
about and one or more responsible persons.

A draft for a DTD of the features file can be found in "kde-features.dtd". Use
"xmllint -valid -noout kde-features.xml" to validate the xml file against the
DTD. If there are errors in the XML document they will be shown, if not the
command will not output anything.

if you have questions or comments please post them to the mailing list or contact
Cornelius Schumacher <schumacher@kde.org>.

   <summary>Write OSplitter.
OSplitter is a widget that adjusts itself to the screen size. On small handheld displays it's a OTabWidget and on bigger screen and on resize it will be a real QSplitter if available
or QHBoxLayout. Currently only horizontal mode is planed.

Primary use: AdvancedFm</summary>

   <summary>class OWidgetStack.
depending on a setting in ODevice it will either be a normal QWidgetStack
and only one window will be shown.
Or in big screen mode instead of an embedded window a toplevel window will
be shown.

Primary use: Todolist View, Addressbook view, Datebook</summary>
   <responsible email="opie-devel@handhelds.org" name="Open" />
  </feature>
  <feature status="todo" target="BigScreen" >
   <summary>classes OAction/OMenuBar/OToolBar if necessary


OAction is a normal QAction but has a  priority of the item. Items often accessed
will have OAction::Always and the least used will have OAction::Seldom. Depending 
on the size of QApplication::Desktop OMenuBar/ToolBar and Popup Menus will
be adjusted.
The goal is to have an automatically adjusting menubar. On a desktop Opie apps will
look like any other desktop app and on a pda we will take care of the space.

On big apps we can make a submenu a new top level menu and provide more toolbars
and on a small display we can if necessary group all menus into one.
Still need to figure out how to the Child relation best

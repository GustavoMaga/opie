Todo for Opie-Eye

1.) Extend BigScreen classes to have something like a combined OSplitter and OWidgetStack.
    On small screens one could toggle this Widget into the View but on BigScreen it would
    be a full widget OToggleSplitter

2.) Write a Image Info Widget which uses the cache to get the thumb and the slave to get
    the info and display it. Make use of OKeyConfigManager to manager keys for up and down
    and left and right to switch between views and go from one image to the next. it would
    emit signals (alwin)

3.) Write Image Display component(zecke)

4.) make the cache tunable at runtime
5.) fix config gui
6.) more Configuration
7.) 2 column mode on big screen
8.) 2/4 pix without info on a row
9.) Performance

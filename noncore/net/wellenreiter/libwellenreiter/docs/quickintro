Name:   libwellenreiter
Author: Martin J. Muench

NOTE: This is just a very short summary of the functions included 
in libwellenreiter, written because a lack of time. The whole 
library will be rewritten with extended documentation and 
test programs.

Included functions:

Log to syslog/info:
void wl_loginfo(const char *, ...);

Log to syslog/err:
void wl_logerr(const char *, ...);

Use like printf() function with format strings and so on.


Setup udp socket for incoming commands:
int commsock(const char *, int);

Fist argument is the host where it should listen and second
is the port.

Return values: 

Send command to udp socket:
int sendcomm(const char *, int, const char *, ...);

First two arguments are the host and port where the command should
be send to, followed by buffer that should be send.

Thats it for the moment.

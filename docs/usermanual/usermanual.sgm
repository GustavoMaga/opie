<chapter><title>What is Opie?</title>
<para>
Opie is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the Linux operating system (and
might work on other OSes as well).  It was originally designed for handheld 
computers (such as the Compaq/HP iPAQ and the Sharp Zaurus), but which could 
probably function well in other environments requiring a light GUI, such as an 
old laptop, or an internet kiosk.  It is bassed upon QT/Embedded from Trolltech,
which is in turn a graphical environment designed for embedded applications,
based upon the QT toolkit.
</para>
<para>
Opie has been designed for devices with small screens, and a touchscreen input 
device (ie, only one mouse click, and no constant mouse position), as well as 
designed to fit in a relatively small amount of storage space (about 5 megabytes
for the base libraries and the launcher).
</para>
</chapter>
<chapter><title>Installation</title>
<section><title>iPAQ</title>
<para>
To install opie on an iPAQ, you will need a fresh Familiar installation (ie,
install Familiar, and stop before you do ipkg install task-complete or ipkg
install task-x), go to http://familiar.handhelds.org to get the latest version,
and to get installation instructions (again, stop after the initial boot and do
not install X, as it is not necessary, and will only take up space).
</para>

<note>
<para>
Note: If you had qpe/qtopia installed previously, \emph{completely} remove it,
and remove the src line for it from your /etc/ipkg.conf file before attempting
to install opie.
</para>
</note>
<para>
Once you have Familiar installed, set up a network connection between your iPAQ
and the ouside world (again, see the Familiar site for instructions on this),
and then run this command:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     echo src opie "http://131.152.105.154/feeds/ipaq/unstable/" \
          >> /etc/ipkg.conf
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
then, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update && ipkg install task-opie
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
If you have a 3100 or 3800 series iPAQ, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg install qt-embedded-rotation
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
finally, start Opie with:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     /etc/init.d/opie start
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
Opie should now be running (if you should have to reboot, which is rare, Opie
will start automatically). From here, you can use either the ``Software'' 
application in the Settings tab, or run ipkg from the command line to install 
other Opie apps. Check out the various task-opie-* ipkgs to install various sets 
of apps at once (you can always uninstall individual apps individually). You
will probably want to install opie-embeddedkonsole first, so you have access to
the command line in Opie. 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Zaurus</title>
<para>
To completely install Opie on the Zaurus, you will have to install OpenZaurus, 
which includes Opie. However, individual Opie applications will work fine on the 
default Zaurus rom. Do not install Opie's launcher on a default Zaurus ROM
though.
</para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter><title>Using Opie</title>
<para>
Now that Opie is installed and running, it's time to start using it.  When you 
first start Opie, you will see the ``Launcher'' from which you can start all of 
your Applications, and the ``Taskbar'' along the bottom, where you can see all 
the running applications, select an input method, and interact with the 
installed ``applets''.
</para>

<section><title>Getting Around</title>
<para>
Getting around in Opie is very easy, you simply click your stylus on whatever 
icon or button you want to click on.  The main difference between using the 
stylus and using a mouse is that you cannot right click with a stylus, so things 
that require a right click are kept to a minimum.  However, it is sometimes
necessary to right click, and this is implemented with a ``press and hold''.
Any time you want to do something that you think would require a right click on
a normal pc, try pressing the stylus down and holding it still for a few
seconds.  This usually opens up a context sensative menu, much like a right
click usually does on a desktop interface.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Launcher</title>
<para>
The Launcher behaves like the ``desktop'' on most PC GUIs.  When no applications 
are running or visible, you will have access to the Launcher.  You can also map
a hardware key to bring the Launcher to the top without closing any of the
running applications (this is similar to ``minimising'' all the applications
that are running).
</para>
<para>
Along the top of the Launcher you will see a list of tabs which function as
categories for your applications.  You can click on the tab for the category you 
want to view, and then click on the icon for the application that you wish to
launch.  By default, there will be an Applications tab and a Settings tab (if 
you install any games, they will appear in the Games tab).  When new 
applications are installed, they will usually appear in one of these three tabs, 
or in a tab of their own.  To add or delete tabs or to move applications between
the tabs, you can use the Tab Manager application, or you can edit them by hand,
by changing the directories in /opt/QtPalmtop/apps.
</para>
<para>
There is also a tab to the far right called the ``Documents'' tab, which allows 
you to quickly open your most often used documents.  You can click on a document 
to open it up in the proper application.  For help on adding files to the
Documents tab see \ref{docadd} on page \pageref{docadd}
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Taskbar</title>
<para>
Opie has a ``Taskbar'' that always runs along the bottom of the screen in Opie, 
except for a few ``fullscreen'' applications that cover it up.  The Taskbar is 
what lets you select which input method you would like to use, shows what 
applications are running, and is also where the ``applets'' draw their icons.  
On the left of the Taskbar is an ``O'' button that opens a menu which has an 
entry for every tab in the Launcher, allowing you to star an applications 
without going back to the Launcher, or quiting the application that you are 
running.  On the right hand side of the Taskbar, you will probably see a clock 
(unless you installed task-opie-minimal), which is actually just another applet 
that draws the time instead of an icon.
</para>
<para>
When an application is run, it adds its icon to the Taskbar, starting from the 
right side of the input method icon, with new application's icons appearing to 
the right.  If you click on the icon for an application, it will be brought to 
the screen, allowing you to interact with it.
</para>
<para>
To the right of the ``O'' menu you will see an icon for the currently selected 
input method.  Clicking this will bring up the input method, allowing you to 
type into the currently running application.  To the right of the input method 
icon is a small arrow pointing up, which will open a menu of all the currently 
installed input methods when clicked.  When you select one of these, it will 
become the current input method, with its icon replacing the previous one.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Dialogs</title>
<para>
In Opie, dialogs, as well as some applications, have a button labeled ``Ok'' on 
the right side of the window title bar, in addition to the normal ``x''.  For 
dialogs, the ``Ok'' button will apply your changes and close the window, while 
the ``x'' will cancel them before closing the window (for people used to most 
desktop GUI's the ``Ok'' and ``x'' behave like the ``Ok'' and ``Cancel'' buttons 
you would normally see in the bottom right of the dialog window).
</para>
<para>
For applications that have an ``Ok'' button as well as the ``x'' button that all
applications have, the ``Ok'' button will usually save the current file and then
close the application, while the ``x'' button will close the application without
saving.
</para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter><title>Upgrading</title>
<para>
First, you should shutdown Opie from the ``Shutdown'' app in the Settings tab. 
Normally, simply running
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update && ipkg upgrade
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
will upgrade Opie. However, if you currently have a version with the 1.5.0 
version number, you will have to upgrade it differently, because Opie now uses a 
different version number (the 1.5.0 was Qtopia's version number, we now use our
own). To upgrade from one of these older versions, run: 
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update
     ipkg install opie-update
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
Opie should then be upgraded.
</para>

<part><title>Applications</title>
<chapter><title>Contacts</title>
<para>
Contacts is a way to keep track of all the people you know, and how to contact 
them.  as well as other information, such as their birthday, the company they 
work for, etc.
<para>

<section><title>Adding Contacts</title>
<para>
To Add a user, go to <GUImenu>Contact</GUImenu><GUIMenuItem>Add</GUIMenuItem>, 
or click the add icon in the toolbar (looks like a blank piece of paper). 
First, you need to give the person a name. You can do this by either entering
their name in the name field, or by pressing ``Full Name...'', which will open
up a new dialog that lets you enter each part of their name individually. Three
of the entry fields have pulldown menus instead of labels that let you set which
parameter these input fields control. The File As field lets you control how
their name is displayed in the main view, use the pulldown arrow to select from
some common ways of ordering their first and last names, or type in a custom
one. You can also select a category for the user to be filed under, and clicking
the button labeled ``...'' lets you edit the available catagories (these are
convinient for displaying just the contacts you want when you have a lot of
them). 
</para>
<para>
The address tab lets you edit the contact's buisness and home addresses (select
which one you want to change from the pulldown menu at the top). The bottom
field behaves just like the three custom fields in the ``General'' tab (and if
you select the same thing from the pulldown list, it will modify the same
parameter). 
</para>
<para>
The Details tab is used for miscelaneous things like the person's position, the 
name of their spouse, etc. 
</para>
<para>
When you are done, click ``Ok'' in the top right of the screen (you can always
edit their profile later), click the ``x'' to cancel, and not add the contact.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Editing Contacts</title>
<para>
To edit the contacts, select the person you want to edit, anc click the pencil 
icon, or go to <GUIMenu>Contact</GUIMenu><GUIMenuItem>Edit</GUIMenuItem>, and it
will open up the same dialog used to add a user, except their information that
is already entered will already be filled in. To finalise the changes, click
``Ok'', or to cancel them, click ``x''. 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Deleting Contacts</title>
<para>
To delete a contact, select the person from the list of contacts, and click the 
trash can icon, or go to Contact \begin{math}\rightarrow\end{math}Delete. A 
dialog will pop up asking if you want to actually delete that contact, click yes 
to delete it, no will cancel.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Editing Contacts</title>
<para>
To find a specific person, click the find icon (green magnifying glass), or go 
to <GUIMenu>Contact</GUIMenu><GUIMenuItem>Find</GUIMenuItem>. A dialog will pop
up, and in the ``Find what'' input, enter the string you want to search for. You
can also select if you want the search to be case sensative, and if you want it
to search backwards from the currently selected user. The Category drop down
menu lets you search only a specific category (``All'' to search all of them).
When you click ``Find'', it will start search for the string in all the fields
in all the contacts. When it finds a match, it will highlight the user in the
main view.  You can use this to search for (as an example) who a certain phone
number belongs to, by entering the phone number in the ``find what'' field, and
clicking ``Find''. 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Viewing Contacts</title>
<para>
To view only the contacts in a certain category, go to the View menu, and check
the categories you want to view. 
</para>
<para>
The list of letters on the bottom of the window lets you look at only the 
contacts who's names begin with that letter. These work much like entering text 
on a mobile phone. For example, to view all the contacts whos name starts with 
``B'', press the ``ABC'' group twice (since ``B'' is the second letter in that 
group). To go back to displaying all of the letters, click it two more times 
(pressing it four times brings you back to all the letters, so you pressed it 2 
times to get to ``B'' and 2 more times to get back to all letters. 2+2=4). 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Personal Details</title>
<para>
Change your personal details by going to <GUIMenu>Contact </GUIMenu>
<GUIMenuItem>My Personal Details</GUIMenuItem>. This is used in today to
display who the device belongs to, as well as other apps.
</para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter><title>Calendar</title>
<para>
The Calendar is a way to keep track of all your appointments, birthdays, 
meetings, or any other event that you would put in a calendar.
</para>

<section><title>Navigation</title>
<para>
Navigation in the Calendar is simple.  Along the top are five different buttons
that allow you to set the type of view, which correspond to the five items in 
the ``View'' menu. Each one (except for ``Today'') changes the amount of time 
shown on the screen. ``Day'' shows one day, ``Week'' one week, etc. Today is the
same as Day, except that it automatically sets the view to the current day.
</para>
<section><title>The Day view</title>
<para>
The day view shows your day divided up into blocks representing each hour. At 
the top is the navigation bar, wher you will see a row of buttons, which 
represent the days of the current week, and on the left and right sides of the 
navigation bar are arrows, which allow you to move one day in that direction. If 
you are on the last day of the week, pressing the arrow will bring you into the
first day of the next week (or vice-versa if you are going backwards). There is
also a button that lists the current day, which you can press to select a day to
view from a calendar dialog.
</para>
<para>
In the main view, there is a collumn of buttons, each of which represents one 
hour. If you select one, any new appointments will automatically default to 
begining at that time and ending an hour later (which you can, of course, change 
when you create the appointment).
</para>
<para>
Clicking on an appointment will open a menu that lets you edit, delete or beam
the appointment. Beam will beam the appointment to any device supporting the
Obex protocol (PalmOS based devices, cellphones, etc). libopieobex must be
installed to use this feature. 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>The Week View</title>
<para>
The week view allows you to see your week divided up into columns, representing 
each day of the week, and rows, representing each hour of the day. In the 
navigation bar at the top, there are two scroll boxes, the one on the left shows 
the current year, and the one to the right shows which week it is of that year.
To the right of both of those is a label which shows the date range for the 
currently selected week.
</para>
<para>
In the main view, you see the week divided up into rows and collumns 
representing the days of the week, and hours of the day. In each cell, you will 
see a blue square which represents an appointment, which you can press to see 
details of the appointment. If you press anywhere in the free space, you will go 
to the day of the column that you clicked in. 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>The Week List View</title>
<para>
The week list view shows you all the appointments that you have that week 
without graphically representing how long they are or showing the free time 
between them. This is convinient if you need to see a list of all your 
appointments, but do not need to see how your time is mapped out. The navigation 
bar has an arrow button on either side, allowing you to move to the next or
previous week, as well as a button which gives the current week number for that 
year. Pressing the week number button will bring up a calendar dialog, which 
allows you to select the week you are viewing. Selecting a day from the calendar 
will bring you to the week that day is in. To the right of that is a button with
a ``2'' in it. When this is depressed, the main view will show two weeks at a
time, instead of one. The last item is a label which shows the range of dates 
for the currently selected week. 
</para>
<para>
The main view is comprised of several rows, each of which represents a day of 
the week. If you have an appointment on that day, the date will be red, 
otherwise it will be black (the current day is blue). Clicking on the date 
itself will bring you to the day view for that day. Under each day is a list of 
all the appointments for that day, as well as their start times. If you click on 
an appointment, you will go to an edit dialog for that appointment, which lets
you view its details. Next to each day heading is a ``+'' sign, clicking it will 
create a new appointment for that day. 
</para>
</section>

<section><title>The Month View</title>
<para>
The month view looks like a normal monthly calendar, allowing you to see on what 
days of the month you have appointments. In the navigation bar, there are two
pairs of arrows. The pair with an arrow and a vertical line will take you to the 
first or last month of the currently selected year, while the normal arrow
buttons will take you to the next or previous month. There is a dropdown menu 
which allows you to select the month, and a entry field which allows you to 
select the year (press the up or down arrows, or enter in your own year).
</para>
<para>
The main view is divided up into a grid, where the columns are the days of the 
week, and the rows are the weeks (just like an ordinary calendar). The currently 
selected day has a bold box drawn around it, and if the day has an appointment,
there will be a small blue square in the bottom right corner of it (that square 
will have a smaller white square if it is a recurring appointment). If the 
appointment is an all day event, it will be drawn as a green dot instead. When 
you click on the sqaure of a day, you will be taken to the day view for that 
day. 
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section><title>Adding Appointments</title>
<para>
To add an appointment, click on the add appointment button in the toolbar at the 
top of the window (an image of a blank page), and a dialog will open up,
allowing you to enter information about the appointment (depending on the
current view, and what you may have selected, there may be certain default
settings).
</para>
<para>
At the top of the window is the description field, where you can enter in a 
short description of the appointment, or select a common one from the dropdown 
list. The location field allows you to do the same. The category dropdown allows 
you to assign the appointment to a category, which you can use later to view
only some of your appointments. The button labeled ``...'' to the right of that
will open up a dialog where you can add, delete, or edit certain categories.
</para>
<para>
To enter a start and end time, select the date for each from the dropdown menu, 
and then you can either manually enter a time, or you can use the three rows of 
numbers to more quickly enter it in. To use the fast input method, first click 
in the text entry field of the time you want to edit, then you need to select 
the hour. The first two rows are the hours, click whichever one you want. The 
third row of numbers are the minutes, in units of five. When you select the 
minutes field for the start time, it will automatically set the minutes field 
for the end time to the same thing, but you can change this by selecting the end 
field and giving it its own minutes field. Because of this, it is fastest to set
the start time first and then the end time. There is also an ``all day''
checkbox, which will make the appointment take up the entire day.
</para>
<para>
Underneath this you can set the timezone of the appointment from the dropdown 
list. To change the available timezones, click the world icon, and it will open 
the City Time application. Refer to its documentation for changing the 
timezones. If you want to have an alarm go off, check the ``alarm'' checkbox, 
and then set the number of minutes before the appointment that you want the
alarm to sound. If you set the dropdown list next to that to ``silent'' you will 
only be given a visual alarm, wheras if you set the alarm to ``Loud'', there
will be an alarm sound as well. Note: opie-alarm must be installed for alarms to 
work.
</para>
<para>
To set whether the appointment repeats, click the "Repeat" button and a new 
dialog will open up. At the top is a row of buttons, which lets you set how 
often the appointment repeats. Selecting one of these buttons will change the 
interface below, to represent the available options for that type of repetition 
(selecting ``None'' will turn off repetition if you turned it on and no longer 
want it). When you are done, click ``ok'' in the upper right to select that type 
of repetition, or ``x'' to set it back to what it was (none if it is a new
appointment).
</para>
<para>
Finally, you can add notes to the appointment by clicking the ``Notes...'' 
button which will open a dialog with a text entry field for adding notes. Press 
``ok'' to accept the changes to the notes, ``x'' to cancel. 
</para>
<para>
When you are done setting up the appointment, click ``ok'' in the top right of
the window, or ``x'' to cancel adding the appointment.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Editing Appointments</title>
<para>
How you start editing an appointment varies depending on what view you are in,
but they will all open the same dialog. The dialog is the same as the Add
Appointment dialog, except that the fields will already be filled in with the
information that the appointment contains. Clicking ``ok'' will keep your
changes, ``x'' will revert them to what they were before you edited them.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Finding Appointments</title>
<para>
To find a specific appointment, click the find button in the toolbar (small 
green magnifying glass) and it will open a find dialog. Here you can enter the 
text you want to search for, as well as the category you want to search for, as 
well as the start date, and whether you want the search to be case sensitive. 
Click ``Find'' to find the next appointment that matches your criteria.
</para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter><title>Todo</title>
<para>
Todo is designed for storing information about things you need to do, but which
arent going to happen at a specific time, like "change the oil" or "mow the
lawn". You can also give todo items a deadline, if they have to be completed by
a certain time. 
</para>

<section><title>Adding Tasks</title>
<para>
Go to Data \begin{math}\rightarrow\end{math}New Task, or click on the new task 
icon (blank page). The priority drop down menu lets you select the priority of 
the task. The lower the number, the more important it is. The categories behave 
in much the same way that they do in Calendar, you can select the category from 
the drop down menu, or you can click the ``...'' button to add, delete, or edit 
categories. To give the task a due date, check the ``Due'' checkbox, and then 
click the button next to it (it should contain the current date). That will open 
a calendar from which you can select the due date. The ``Completed'' check box
is the same as the checkbox next to each item in the main view. The ``Summary''
field is for a short summary that will be visible in the main view, as well as
in the Today application.  The down arrow next to it will copy the text in the
``Summary'' field into the large text field below it, which is used for a more
detailed description of the task.  Click ``ok'' in the upper right to add the
new task, or ``x'' to close the window without adding the new task.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Editing Tasks</title>
<para>
To edit a task, you can select it, and then go to 
<GUIMenu>Data</GUIMenu><GUIMenuItem>Edit
Task</GUIMenuItem>, or click the edit task icon (an image of a pencil). The same
dialog should apear as if you were adding a task, but the information for that
task should already be filled in. You can change any of it you want to, and then
click ``ok'' in the top right corner to save the changes, or ``x'' to go back to
the way it was.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Deleting Tasks</title>
<para>
To delete a task, first select it, and then either select 
<GUIMenu>Data</GUIMenu>
<GUIMenuItem>Delete...</GUIMenuItem> or press the Delete icon (an image of
a trash can). A dialog should pop up, asking if you want to delete the task,
click yes to delete it, or no to cancel.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Finding Tasks</title>
<para>
To find a task, either go to 
<GUIMenu>Options</GUIMenu><GUIMenuItem>Find</GUIMenuItem>
, or
click the find icon (an image of a green magnifying glass), and a dialog should
pop up. Enter the text you want to search for in the description, and select the 
category that you want it to search through (this will speed the search up, if
you know what category it is in). You can also select ``case sensative'' which 
makes the search pay attention to the case of what you type (so if you look for 
``mow lawn'', it won't find a task called ``Mow lawn''). ``Search Backwards'' 
will search backwards from the currently selected task. Click ``Find'' to 
initiate the search, when it finds a task that matches the string, it will 
select it. If you click Find again, it will find the next one in the list (or 
the previous one, if ``Search backwards'' is selected).
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Viewing Tasks</title>
<para>
To only view tasks filled under certain categories, go to the Category menu, and 
check the categories you want to view. Also, under the Options menu, you can
select whether or not you want completed tasks to be visible, and whether or not 
you want to see the deadline.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Completing Tasks</title>
<para>
To mark a task as completed without deleting it, you can either check the 
checkbox next to it in the main view, or edit it, and check the "completed" 
check box in the edit dialog. If <GUIMenu>Options</GUIMenu>
<GUIMenuItem>Completed<GUIMenuItem> tasks is not checked, the task will
disapear when you mark it completed. but do not worry, it is not gone forever, 
just check Completed tasks in the options menu, and you can see and edit it 
again.
</para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter><title>File Manager</title>
<para>
The file manager allows easy access to your file system, letting you browse, 
copy, move, delete and link files.  You can also use it to open the file in an 
application based upon the file type, or add the file to your ``Documents'' tab, 
as well as several other filesystem related things.
<para>

<section><title>Navigating</title>
<para>
To enter a directory, simply press its icon or name in the main view. There are 
also two buttons in the toolbar which help with navigation. The back arrow will 
take you back to the directory you were previously looking at, while the up 
arrow will take you up one level in the directory structure (so, if you are in 
/usr/bin, it will take you to /usr, regardless of where you were before). The 
``Dir'' menu shows the current path, with each directory as a menu item. So, if 
you are in /opt/QtPalmtop/bin there will be four entries: /, opt, QtPalmtop, and 
bin. Selecting one of these will take you immediately to that directory.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Selecting Files</title>
<para>
When you click on a file, its selection status is toggled. So the first time you 
click on it, it will be selected, and the second time it will be deselected. To
select multiple files, simply click on each one you want to select.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Moving Files</title>
<para>
To copy a file from one directory to another, press and hold on the filename, 
and select ``Copy'' from the menu that pops up. Then, change into the directory 
that you want to copy it into, and press the "paste" icon (an image of a 
clipboard and a piece of paper). To move a file, do the same thing, except 
select ``Cut'' from the first menu, instead of ``Copy''. You can also move or 
copy multiple files by selecting all of them and using the cut or copy buttons 
in the toolbar.

text'' which will open the file up in TextEdit (regardless of whether or not it 
is actually a text file).

<section><title>Sorting Files</title>
<para>
To sort the files, use the ``Sort'' menu to select wich field you want to sort

if it is not, they will be sorted in descending order.  You can also press the
name of the column in the main view to sort by that field.

links to other files or directories) will be visible.

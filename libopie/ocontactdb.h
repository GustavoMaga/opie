 * History:
 * $Log: ocontactdb.h,v $
 * Revision 1.1.2.9  2002-07-14 13:41:30  eilers
 * Some bugfixes,
 * Added interface for searching contacts in database, using "query by example"
 * like system
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.8  2002/07/13 17:19:20  eilers
 * Added signal handling:
 * The database will be informed if it is changed externally and if flush() or
 * reload() signals sent. The application which is using the database may
 * reload manually if this happens...
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.7  2002/07/07 16:24:47  eilers
 * All active parts moved into the backend. It should be easily possible to
 * use a database as backend
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.6  2002/07/07 12:40:35  zecke
 * Why was this there in the first place?
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.5  2002/07/06 16:06:52  eilers
 * Some bugfixes and cleanup of inconsistencies
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.4  2002/07/05 13:03:30  zecke
 * Move the stuff responsible for loading and unloading
 * out of the ContactDB. This will make the switch to a real
 * database more easy.
 * Contact::insert is private so I had to workaround this 'feature'
 * CVS
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.3  2002/07/05 11:17:19  zecke
 * Some API updates by me
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.2  2002/07/03 06:55:54  eilers
 * Moved to LGPL
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2002/07/01 16:49:46  eilers
 * First attempt for cross reference
 *
 * =====================================================================
 * This database emits the following signal if the xml-file is changed:
 * Channel: "QPE/PIM", Message: "addressbookUpdated()"
 * Every Application which receives this message should reload the
 * database and update the widgets to stay synchronized..

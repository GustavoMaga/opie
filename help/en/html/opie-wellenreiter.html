Wellenreiter is a network security tool. It needs the libpcap-package
to be also installed.

<h2>Wellenreiter usage:</h2>
<P>Wellenreiter must first be set up in the <b>Configuration Dialog</b>
available from the toolbar button. If you configured your device, then
you can start sniffing by pressing the appropriate toolbar button.
If Wellenreiter finds any devices in range, it will show them in the
main window grouped by Service Set ID (SSID).

<h2>Wellenreiter configuration:</h2>
At the moment, only the device configuration settings are honored.
Choose the name and type of your wireless network interface, e.g.
eth0/Orinoco or wlan0/hostap or wifi0/cisco.

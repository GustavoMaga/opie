<section><title>&ipaq;</title>
<para>
To install &opie; on an &ipaq;, a recent Familiar installation will be needed. Go to
the Familiar project homepage (http://familiar.handhelds.org) to download the latest
version of the "bootstrap" image (do not install the bootstrap-opie or bootstrap-gpe
images). Follow the instructions on the Familiar website to install the image. Do not
install the task-complete or task-x packages as they are not needed to run &opie; and
will unnecessarily occupy space on the &ipaq;.
</para>

<para>
A network connection needs to be configured on the &ipaq; in order to download the
&opie; packages from the feed. The Familiar site provides instructions for connecting
to the Internet in a variety of ways. 
</para>

<para>
&opie; requires the libpng3 package to be installed. Prior to installing &opie;, ensure
that this package is installed. It is available in the Familiar feed and can be installed
by running this command:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg install libpng3
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you had QPE/QTopia installed previously, <emphasis>completely</emphasis> remove
it, and then remove the source line for that feed from your /etc/ipkg.conf file before
attempting to install &opie;.
</para>
</note>
<para>
Once you have Familiar installed (including libpng3), and the network connection
between the &ipaq; and the outside world, run the following command:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     echo src opie "http://opie.handhelds.org/feed/ipaq/unstable/" \
          >> /etc/ipkg.conf
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
then, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update && ipkg install task-opie
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
If you have a 3100 or 3800 series &ipaq;, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg install libqt2-emb-fonts
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
finally, start &opie; with:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     /etc/init.d/opie start
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<section><title>&zaurus;</title>
<para>
&opie; applications will install and run on the default &zaurus; ROM with no problems,
except for Launcher. It is not compatible with the default ROM, and should not be
installed.
</para>

<para>
Another option is to replace the default &zaurus; ROM with the OpenZaurus
ROM image. OpenZaurus is a openly developed Linux distribution designed to run on the
&zaurus;, and uses &opie; as its default user interface. For more information and
installation instructions, please visit their site, http://www.openzaurus.org/.

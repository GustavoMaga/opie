This library contains auxilliary stuff from Qt/Embedded 2.3.x which
is very useful but has been left out from qconfig-qpe.h.

Note: We can't just enable the said classes in our qconfig, because that
      would mean we no longer could link to a sharp rom libqpe.

Also note: We don't ship that embedded in libopie2
           (nor do we use it from libopie2), because we want to keep
           libopie2 LGPL - hence Opie stuff using these classes is also here.

It could be useful to eventually have some original classes
providing similar functionality.

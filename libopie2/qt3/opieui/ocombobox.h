/**
 * A combined button, line-edit and a popup list widget.
 *
 * @par Detail
 *
 * This widget inherits from @ref QComboBox and implements
 * the following additional functionalities:  a completion
 * object that provides both automatic and manual text
 * completion as well as text rotation features, configurable
 * key-bindings to activate these features, and a popup-menu
 * item that can be used to allow the user to set text completion
 * modes on the fly based on their preference.
 *
 * To support these new features OComboBox also emits a few
 * more additional signals as well.  The main ones are the
 * @ref completion( const QString& ) and @ref textRotation( KeyBindingType )
 * signals.  The completion signal is intended to be connected to a slot
 * that will assist the user in filling out the remaining text while
 * the rotation signals is intended to be used to traverse through all
 * possible matches whenever text completion results in multiple matches.
 * The @ref returnPressed() and @ref returnPressed( const QString& )
 * signal is emitted when the user presses the Enter/Return key.
 *
 * This widget by default creates a completion object when you invoke
 * the @ref completionObject( bool ) member function for the first time
 * or use @ref setCompletionObject( OCompletion*, bool ) to assign your
 * own completion object.  Additionally, to make this widget more functional,
 * OComboBox will by default handle the text rotation and completion
 * events internally whenever a completion object is created through either
 * one of the methods mentioned above.  If you do not need this functionality,
 * simply use @ref OCompletionBase::setHandleSignals( bool ) or alternatively
 * set the boolean parameter in the above methods to FALSE.
 *
 * The default key-bindings for completion and rotation is determined
 * from the global settings in @ref OStdAccel.  These values, however,
 * can be overriden locally by invoking @ref OCompletionBase::setKeyBinding().
 * The values can easily be reverted back to the default setting, by simply
 * calling @ref useGlobalSettings(). An alternate method would be to default
 * individual key-bindings by usning @ref setKeyBinding() with the default
 * second argument.
 *
 * Note that if this widget is not editable ( i.e. select-only ), then only
 * one completion mode, @p CompletionAuto, will work.  All the other modes are
 * simply ignored.  The @p CompletionAuto mode in this case allows you to
 * automatically select an item from the list by trying to match the pressed
 * keycode with the first letter of the enteries in the combo box.
 *
 * @par Usage
 *
 * To enable the basic completion feature:
 *
 * <pre>
 * OComboBox *combo = new OComboBox( true, this, "mywidget" );
 * OCompletion *comp = combo->completionObject();
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(combo,SIGNAL(returnPressed(const QString&)),comp,SLOT(addItem(const QString&));
 * </pre>
 *
 * To use your own completion object:
 *
 * <pre>
 * OComboBox *combo = new OComboBox( this,"mywidget" );
 * OURLCompletion *comp = new OURLCompletion();
 * combo->setCompletionObject( comp );
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(combo,SIGNAL(returnPressed(const QString&)),comp,SLOT(addItem(const QString&));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that you have to either delete the allocated completion object
 * when you don't need it anymore, or call
 * setAutoDeleteCompletionObject( true );
 *
 * Miscellaneous function calls:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Tell the widget not to handle completion and rotation
 * combo->setHandleSignals( false );
 * // Set your own completion key for manual completions.
 * combo->setKeyBinding( OCompletionBase::TextCompletion, Qt::End );
 * // Hide the context (popup) menu
 * combo->setContextMenuEnabled( false );
 * // Temporarly disable signal emition
 * combo->disableSignals();
 * // Default the all key-bindings to their system-wide settings.
 * combo->useGlobalKeyBindings();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @short An enhanced combo box.

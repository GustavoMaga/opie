The "Software" application, also called oipkg, is what is used to install and
remove software.  It is actually a frontend to the command line program "ipkg"
so most things you can do with oipkg you can also do with ipkg.  Oipkg can
install things either remotely from a web server (called a "feed") or it can
install an ipkg package file that resides on the local filesystem.

There is a bug in oipkg that prevents it from installing packages
properly.  There is, however, a workaround for it.  Simply run oipkg from
Embedded Konsole to avoid the bug.

To install software, first select "Opie" from the "Section" pulldown menu,
the press the "+" icon next to "Feeds" in the main view.  This will show all
the available Opie packages (you can change which packages to view by selecting
something else from the "Section" pulldown).  Installed packages are marked
with a blue circle, while packages that are not installed are marked with a red
box.  If you click on the icon for an uninstalled package, it will turn into an
open box, with a blue circle coming out of it, indicating that you have marked
this package to be installed.  Mark as many packages as you wish this way, and
then press the "Apply" icon (same red box and blue dot icon) to install all
the marked packages.  It will also remove any packages marked for removal (see
below).  Clicking this will open a window showing all the packages marked to be
removed and installed, with some check boxes on the bottom, which represent
arguments to be sent to ipkg, which you can usually ignore.  After verifying
that all the packages to be installed are correct, press "Ok" in the upper
right corner (or press "x" to cancel and go back to the package selection
window).  The packages should then install, and you should see their icons
appear in the Launcher, if they are Opie applications.

<section><title>Removing Software</title>
<para>
Removing software is the same as installing software, except you will press the
blue circle icon of an installed package, and it will have a red "X" over it.  
Then press the apply icon, and "Ok".  You can install and remove packages at
the same time by marking the ones you want to install and the ones you want to 
remove, and then pressing apply.

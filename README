How to use the new build system
===============================

First of all set the PATH to ensure your crosscompiler is available,
and set QTDIR to point to your qt/embedded source tree.

Then do the following in the opie source tree:

make clean
make menuconfig

Now you can move through the menu and select or deselect anything..
Exit and save the configuration and enter "make" to create opie...

Have fun with it !

Ciao, Stefan

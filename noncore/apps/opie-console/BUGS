Ok we all know we write perfect code
but sometimes the compiler produces bad code
and we need to work around some compiler bugs!! -zecke


Send/receive: lrzsz behaves strange when trying to use
--overwrite or --rename.

- transfer dialog is still a top dialog instead on the widgetstack of of the
connection its used on

- keys and buttonbar merge

- keys really working
 mc is working
 but F11 on bar seems to be the F10 key and so on
 F9 is F8... -zecke
 Should be fixed -zecke

- scripting with "direct subpopup"
  also:
  - an indication that it is currently recording, also change menu entry to
  "cancel recording" then   

- scripts need an extension and also an icon

- help documentation needs to be extended
  - new connection and save connection 
  - paste  button
  - keys button

- dial dialog - ugly , better use a qlineedit there to for showing or
  disable

- exit / strg + d does not close conection / tab

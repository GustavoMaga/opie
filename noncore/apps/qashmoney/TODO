QashMoney Budget Software for the Sharp Zaurus

TODO

Planned features for QashtMoney include:

-  Go to another account from within the transactionwindow
-  Move a transaction from one account to another
-  Purge transactions (remove them without effecting the account balances).
-  Add difference account types such as stocks, etc.  Basically I want it to
   becoming a full featured money app, hence the name!!
-  Open Financial Exchange protocol support
-  Allow limiting the number of transactions that are displayed when showing cleared transactions.
   This will become important when a database becomes very large as the program will
   slow greatly if it retrieves serveral hundred transactions to view.

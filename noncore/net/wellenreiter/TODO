- beep over headphone / customizable

- identification of probe requests
  i.e. other sniffers around

- decloaking of falsely reported zero-length SSIDs

- option to launch an external application (i.e. qcop) on
  - new net
  - new station
  - <whatever> event

- adaptive hopping scheme !

- display interface capabilities

- enable sniffing in wired networks

- enable multiple packet sources
  - infrared
  - bluetooth
  - usb?

- define packet structure in a metalanguage and generate
  the actual parsing code (hmmm)

- pester the ethereal folks to settle for an application independant
  packet dissection framework... (unlikely)

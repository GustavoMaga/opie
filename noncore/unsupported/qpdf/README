QPDF - a PDF viewer for the Qtopia environment

This tool is based on xpdf (currently 1.01). It uses the (mostly unmodified -
see below) xpdf PDF rendering engine. The Qtopia adaption was done with a new 
OutputDev which renders directly to a QPixmap via QPainter calls.

Changes in 20020406:
 - Font substitution handling improved.
 - Unknown characters are simply ignored now.
 - Fullscreen view added.
 
Changes in 20020407:
 - Crash with FontName == 0 fixed
 - Cleanup
 - Prepare for CVS import

Changes in 20020408:
 - Progress indicator added
 - Problems with type 3 fonts (not fully supported by XPDF) solved
 - Heavy optimizations in the image rendering code

Changes in 20020413:
 - Fixed crash in find routine
 - Stylus selection reworked
 - Cursor-key navigation added
 - Various crashes related to recursive calling of XPDF fixed 

Changes in 20020417:
 - Fixed crash in XPDF regarding 0-length strings.
 - Fast sqrt, rint and fabs functions added. 

Changes in 20020524:
 - Ported to xpdf 1.01


Changes to xpdf:
 - xpdf calculates nearly everything with doubles. Since ARMs are not equipped
   with a FPU, all doubles have been replaced with a C++ class "fouble" (fixed
   double), which operates on 32bit integers with fixed point arithmetic.
   This gave a speedup of up to 800% for image rendering.
   
 - No Font handling anymore - This means no embedded, no true-type, no type1-
   fonts. The task to choose the right font is up to the Qt QFont class.
   This works pretty well -- only Symbol fonts give problems.
   
 - Everything that should be rotated (fonts, images) is simply ignored, because
   a) the Qtopia Qt/E config has QPainter transformations disabled
   b) the transformation is awful slow
   c) do you really need rotated images on your iPaq ? ;)

   
ToDo:
 - Clipping has been deactivated, because Qt/E had problems with QPainter
   save/restore's with active clipping regions. I need to investigate this
   in detail.
   
 - Links are currently simply ignored.

 
Install:
 - Qpdf is now fully integrated into Opie. For compilation and installation
   instructions see http://opie.handhelds.org.

 - compress / uncompress
   If you run a normal familiar installation, the standard gzip (I tested
   1.2.4-33 ipkg) can handle the compression format used in PDF files, when 
   called as uncompress. The BusyBox version of gzip can _not_ handle this 
   old format.
   
   If you do not have a working uncompress installed on your iPaq, you could 
   simply use the old compress package.
   (I could not find an official tarball for compress -- I used the SuSE
   version cross-compiled for ARM for myself, but I will make an ipk soon)
       
   
Have fun ;)

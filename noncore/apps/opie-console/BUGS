Ok we all know we write perfect code
but sometimes the compiler produces bad code
and we need to work around some compiler bugs!! -zecke


Send/receive: lrzsz behaves strange when trying to use
--overwrite or --rename.

- console should autoconnect by default

- keys and buttonbar merge

- keys really working
 mc is working
 but F11 on bar seems to be the F10 key and so on
 F9 is F8... -zecke
 Should be fixed -zecke

- scripting with "direct subpopup"
  also:
  - an indication that it is currently recording, also change menu entry to
  "cancel recording" then   

- kill more compiler warnings.

- more colorshemes ( "orange is ugly" )

- irda and bluetooth out ( can be done with normal serial as long as the
connection is allready up, and extended stuff is a lot of work; maybe later
in again ).

- new conntection -> configure -> use . does not end up in profile dialog,

- copy n paste as default setup keys in "keys"

- console mode quick button in menubar?

- disable tranfer file for console mode

- scripts need an extension and also an icon

- help documentation needs to be extended

New Launcher TODO:

[x] Split QWS Server out of launcher/taskbar application
[ ] Handling of default Opie env vars that may or may not be
    affected by ODevice.  This should really affect all Opie apps..
    perhaps in qpeapplication, or a seperate app that sets the env vars
    for Opie ala the way ssh-agent outputs an eval'able set of vars.

[.] QWS Server
	[x] actual qws server (qpeapplication as GuiServer)
	[x] qcop bridge
	[x] transfer server (sync compatibility)
	[ ] calibration QCop calls (to split calibration into a seperate app)
	[ ] window list / management QCop calls (matchbox style task switching)
	[ ] qws event filter hooks
		[ ] Touch and Key clicks
		[ ] xstroke style input

[ ] Launcher/Taskbar
	[ ] Proper VT handling, and VT switching - qt/e + qpeapplication.. every app needs to handle this properly
	[ ] Proper timezone handling (create localtime link) - belongs in that which handles the time. clock applet, systemtime.
	[ ] LauncherView as plugins, possibly allow the plugin to add any
	    arbitary number of tabs, in which case the launcher is simply
	    a tab bar with plugins, the default being the AppLnk and Docs
	    scanning plugins, to give us the current functionality.

[ ] Uncertain
	[ ] Alerts - mem and battery
	[ ] OpieScreenSaver
	[.] package slave - essentially take bridged qcop message, pass it
	    along to the app which is associated with the .ipk mime type.

#include <wellenreiter/wl_sock.hh>

int wl_setupsock(const char *host, int port, struct sockaddr_in *)
int wl_send(const char *host, int port, const char *string, ...)
int wl_recv(int *socket, struct sockaddr_in *, char *out, int len)


wl_setupsock() returns the number of the activated udp socket.

wl_send() sends string to the given host.

wl_recv() checks for incoming data on a socket (created using
wl_setupsock()). It writes the incoming data to out with a
maxlen of len.


wl_setupsock() returns -1 on error and the number of socket on
success.
wl_send() returns 0 on error and 1 on success.
wl_recv() returns -1 on error and the type of the received packet
on success.

Note: To use this function you have to set a sockaddr_in structure
and pass it to wl_setupsock and wl_receive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/1/02 - Initial release of 0.2 version.  Considered stable beta version.
11/16/02 - Release of version 0.3.  This is a stable version adding function to
 transfer money between accounts.  Several bugs fixes and speed enhancements
 have been done.
11/21/02 - 0.31 news tabs working but not yet displaying accounts
12/15/02 - QashMoney gets a complete face lift and now has a date picker.
12/29/02 - Version 0.41 released.  This release fixes more bugs and adds a
 function to manage transaction memory items.
12/31/02 - Version 0.42 released.  Maintenance release fixing soem rather nasty
 bugs that screw up account, transaction, and transfer displays.
03/03/03 - Version 0.60 released.  QashMoney has undergone quite a transformation.
 A new GUI that incorporates all of Qts excellent layout capabilities should
 display nicely in all formats.  A new embedded SQL database should make QashMoney
very extensible.
4/25/03 - Version 0.70 released.  This version includes many new features over 0.60 including
currency support for accounts, a function to limit transaction views, and an all new budgeting
tab that allows multiple budgets and currency support.
5/7/03 - Version 0.73 released.  Few minor bugfixes and feature enhancements.  QashMoney now
right justifies all numbers and remembers the sate in which you leave the account window.  So, if you
collapse a parent account, it will stay collapsed (even between QashMoney restarts).

What is Opie PIM? Why is it special?
Why do we need Opie PIM?

The goal of OpiePIM is to be first of all 
extendable, light weight, scalable and fast.
For the programmer we try to add a nice but 
powerful API to all classes.

Memory is a costy resource on small and embedded
devices. So we try to keep the memory usage as 
low as possible. Never the less we won't use structs
and Pointers in the public API.
The whole pim framework is value based. Internally we try
to use implicit sharing as found in other Qt classes as well.
This makes it possible to give 3rd party devels a nice
API while keeping the memory usage as low as possible.

We use C++ Templates

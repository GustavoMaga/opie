<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AdvancedFm is an advanced file management for Opie. Using the two
tabs, you can move, rename, copy, symlink, set file permissions between the two directories.
<br>All actions on a file can be found by holding your stylus down on a
file. A popup menu will appear.
<br>If you have a Control key available, you can select multiple
files, by holding the Ctrl key while you highlight the files.
This way you can symlink selected files in a directory to the directory
in the other tab.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also run commands on files, on in a directory by
selecting "Run Command" from the menu. "Run Command with output" will
send the standard output from your command to a widget so you can see, or study it. You
can also save it to a file if you wish.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buttons at top change your current directory to (from left to
right)<br>
[$QPEDIR] [/mnt/cf] [/mnt/sd] (<-for those that have it)   [cd up parent dir]
[~/Documents]  [$HOME]

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can type a directory into the edit combo at the top, hit enter
and change to it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The titlebar at top tells you what filesystem is used on the
current directory, and how much free space is available there.

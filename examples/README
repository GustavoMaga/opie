Hi newbie,
this directory contains a set of examples for various
API you may want to use. The examples go from simple
to harder and must be understand as an extension
of the examples from Qt in your source package.
Be sure to look there at first and at their excelent 
tutorials as well.

Note: that some files are found in apps/Examples to really
show how to include apps properly.

Note: to integrate your apps into the build 
    make clean-configs
    put your application into a sourcedir
    edit $OPIEDIR/packages
    make 

Naming Conventions:
    Most of the time we prefix member variables with m_. This allows
    us to see if a variable in a function is a member
    or on the stack.
    Function naming we use setFooBar() but fooBar() to get the
    value. So please skip the get you're used from Java.
    Other than that please try to avoid #ifdef and #defines
    use const but we do not have any coding style convetions.

        <source>&lt;qt&gt;&lt;h1&gt;SFCave Help&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt; SFCave is a flying game for the Zaurus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The aim is to stay alive for as long as possible and get the highest score you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three game types currently - SFCave, Gates, and Fly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SFCave&lt;/b&gt; is a remake of the classic SFCave game - fly through the cavern avoiding all the blocks that just happen to be hanging in midair&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gates&lt;/b&gt; is similar to SFCave but instead you must fly through the without crashing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fly&lt;/b&gt; is somewhat different to SFCave and above. Instead, you have are flying in the open air above a scrolling landscape, and the aim is to hug the ground - the closer to the land you fly the more points scored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basic instruction - Press &lt;b&gt;Up&lt;/B&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Down&lt;/b&gt; on the circle pad to start a new game, press the middle of the pad to apply thrust (makes you go up), and release the pad to remove thrust and drop down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, if playing the Fly game, you can press z to toggle the display of the scoring zones. This will display 4 red lines at varying heights above the landscape - if your ship falls into this zone, point are scored. The closer to the landscape you get the more points you get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, SFCave has replays - save and load too so you can show off to all your friends (or vice versa). Currently, this is in its infancy but will improve.&lt;br&gt;To use, once you have crashed, press &apos;r&apos; to replay the last game.&lt;br&gt;To save the replay press &apos;s&apos;.&lt;br&gt;To load a saved replay press &apos;l&apos; (after you&apos;ve crashed at least once).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Replays are currently saved to your home directory in a file called sfcave.replay.This file can be copied and given to others as long as it it put in their home directory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have lots of fun.&lt;br&gt;Andy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/qt&gt;</source>

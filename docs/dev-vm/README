Welcome to the Opie development VM!
===================================

This is a pre-configured virtual machine running OpenSUSE 11.2, with all of
the required development software installed for Opie development and testing
(on i386). It also includes pre-compiled source trees for opkg and libetpan
to allow opie-packagemanager and opie-mail development.

Note that this VM is not set up for any kind of cross-compilation. (For that
you should set up and use OpenEmbedded or Scratchbox etc.) On the other hand,
there's still a lot of development that can be done without having to run 
Opie on an actual device, and this VM should help with that.


Setting up the environment
--------------------------

Before running or building Opie you will need to run the following (for
each new session):

cd ~/opie
source ./setupenv

Note that this environment will of course only persist within the terminal
session it is typed into.


Running
-------

To run an Opie session, ensure the Qt2 Virtual Framebuffer application is
running (icon on the desktop) then run the following commands:

cd opie/bin
./qpe -qws


Updating sources
----------------

To get the latest source code, simply run the following:

git pull

Rebuilding should usually be as simple as:

make


Misc
----

* Qt2 Designer and Virtual Framebuffer tools are linked from the desktop &
  launch menu.
* Firefox has been set up with links to the Opie website, Opie project on 
  gitorious.org, and the (local) Qt 2.3 reference documentation.
* Passwords for root and the default user (opiedev) are set to "opiedev". You
  should probably change these if you intend to make regular use of the VM.

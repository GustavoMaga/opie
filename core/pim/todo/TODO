HI,
this is the Todo for the TODO Application.

I started a small rewrite of the whole application.
The idea is to have only the necessary bits
in memory at once.
It's meant to be extandable and exchangable.
I've TodoView as a Baseclass for all Views representationg
todos. So you could have a QTable or QListView todo

What's missing is:
Implementation of the views.
The MainWindow Implementation
The connection between the Parts

Stuff todo until OPIE 1.0 :
===========================

Feature requests:
-----------------
- Dial by mobile phone by tapping the number.. 
  (Maybe using gsmtool. And we may
	add a library class for this)
- dial with dtmfdial in case it's installed and there's no mobile
- 3rd column for 2. Contact
- Implementing additional Views (Phonebook, ...)
- Birthday & Anniversary Reminder
- Beaming of multiple contacts (current list/ by search or by category)
- Configure the letter-picker: lastname/fullname search 
- Optionally put scrollbars left.

Known Bugs:
-----------

Urgent:
--------
- Category is on the wrong position after changing to personal and back to normal
	( Temporarily workaround: Category is never deactivated.. :S )


Important:
----------

- "What's this" should be added (Deleyed after Feature Freeze)

Less important:
---------------
- Reload if contacts were changed externally
- The picker (alphabetical sort widget) should be
   placed verticaly or horizontally (configurable)
- Find a smart solution for activating/deactivating the "send email" event
- If new contact is added (contacteditor closed): focus (table, card) to
  this entry !
- After search (Started with Return): KeyFocus should be on Tabelle

ContactEditor:
- Redesign of Contacteditor

Should be Fixed (not absolute sure, need further validation):
-------------------------------------------------------------


Fixed/Ready:

- Find widget should be replaced by something like 
  qpdf has.

- contacteditor: Birthday, annyversary, ... : Use Dateselector
- The names of the countries are sorted by there english names, only..
  Even if they are translated.. :S
- Cursor keys should work in detail-view (ablabel)
  -> Ablabel should be removed and Abtable should be increased with
	different views (as started by darwin zins)..
- Use advanced database functions in abtable to decrease
  memory footprint and to make everything more easy !
	(abtable should store Iterator for selected Category)
- Abtable: Configure Contact column (internally already available, 
	need configuration)

- After finising search and after Edit: Clear Picker
- After Edit: Table position back to edited entry.

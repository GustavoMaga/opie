Stuff todo until OPIE 1.0 :
===========================

Feature requests:
-----------------
- Dial by mobile phone by tapping the number.. 
  (Maybe using gsmtool. And we may
	add a library class for this)
- dial with dtmfdial incase it's installed and there's no mobile
- 3rd column for 2. Contact
- Implementing additional Views (Phonebook, ...)

Known Bugs:
-----------
- OK-Key does not switch from Detailview (ablable) to Listview
- Personal Details: Anniversary zeigt Fantasie-Werte

Bugs but not in addressbook:
-----------------------------
- VCARD: Import of Anniversary does not work correctly (currently disabled)
- VCARD: If umlaut (äöüß) in address, the parser gets confused..


Urgent:
--------
- Contact-Editor is temporarely reanabled. Wait for replacement.
- Redesign of Contacteditor
- Store last settings of combo-boxes
- Name order selected in "contacteditor" not used in list view.
- Category is on the wrong position after changing to personal and back to normal


Important:
----------

- After search (Started with Return): KeyFocus should be on Tabelle
- Searchwidget closed: Selected user is jumping
- Wenn suchen beendet, dann dauert das Tabellenupdate (was überhaupt überflüssig ist)
	zu lange..

- Store position and state of toolbar

- IRDA Receive: Contact is added, but start of editor with new entry expected..
- "What's this" should be added (Deleyed after Feature Freeze)

Less important:
---------------
- Reload if contacts were changed externally
- Overview window cleanup needed..
- The picker (alphabetical sort widget) should be
   placed verticaly or horizontally (configurable)
- Find a smart solution for activating/deactivating the "send email" event

Should be Fixed (not absolute sure, need further validation):
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Unfiled shown just in Category "All" and "Unfiled". 

Fixed:
-------
- Syncing: abtable not reloaded after sync.
- Find widget should be replaced by something like 
  qpdf has.
- Adding a configuration dialog
- Picker: Activated letter schould be more visible
- Advanced handling of cursor keys (search..)
- Mail-Icon is missing
- Use opie-mail insted of qt-mail if possible.
- Font menu is invisible using german translation
- Personal contact editor: Disable categories
- "Nonenglish" translation bug has to be fixed.
- contacteditor: Birthday, annyversary, ... : Use Dateselector
- The names of the countries are sorted by there english names, only..
  Even if they are translated.. :S
- Cursor keys should work in detail-view (ablabel)
  -> Ablabel should be removed and Abtable should be increased with
	different views (as started by darwin zins)..
- Use advanced database functions in abtable to decrease
  memory footprint and to make everything more easy !
	(abtable should store Iterator for selected Category)
- Abtable: Configure Contact column (internally already available, 
	need configuration)
- Select of primary contact (see #274 on mantis)
- Category-select does not work completely: "Unfiled" is always in listview ..
- Return from Contacteditor: Category resettet to all
- Personal Details not working
- If category changed, the letterpicker should be resetted
- There should be some icons for List and Cardview
- If in Cardview and a category change removes all entries: 
	There are already entries in Cardview after up/down

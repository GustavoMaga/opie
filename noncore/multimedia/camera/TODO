- ask before overwriting existing pictures
- improve video performance by using a seperate thread
- make command line capturing more sophisticated
    - add -n <number_of_captures>, 0 for unlimited
    - add -d <delay_in_seconds_between_captures>
    - add commands like 'init', 'capture', 'exit' to give more control and to cope with the delay lightning problem

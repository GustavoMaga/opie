This file serves as central repository of planned KDE features. It's parsed by
the PHP scripts in "features.inc" which are used by "kde-3.2-features.html" to
generate HTML versions for the web.

If you plan to add a feature to KDE please add it to this file. A feature can
have one of three status types: "todo", "inprogress", "done". Please update
the status from time to time. For a release there shouldn't be any features
with other states than "done". If you can't complete a feature for a release
please move the feature to the next release. The "target" attribute specifies
for which release the feature should be finished. At the moment only the value
"3.2" is evaluated, but we will add pages showing the features for later
versions as needed.

Each feature consists of a summary giving a short description what the feature is
about and one or more responsible persons.

A draft for a DTD of the features file can be found in "kde-features.dtd". Use
"xmllint -valid -noout kde-features.xml" to validate the xml file against the
DTD. If there are errors in the XML document they will be shown, if not the
command will not output anything.

If you have questions or comments please post them to the mailing list or contact
Cornelius Schumacher <schumacher@kde.org>.

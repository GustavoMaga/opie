This package requires flex, bison and qt to compile (actually it's
possible without qt, but you'll miss most of the fun :) ).
On most systems a simple 'make' should be enough, if you have qt
installed in unusual location either set the QTDIR environment variable
or issue 'make QTDIR=<path>'.

'make install KERNELSRC=<path/to/linux/kernel> should be enough to
install the package. The path must point to recent kernel sources,
which will be converted to use this package. With 'make uninstall
KERNELSRC=...' the package can be removed from the kernel again.

lkc include a SWIG interface file. 'make ruby' builds a extension
library for ruby in the .ruby dir.

Have fun, Roman

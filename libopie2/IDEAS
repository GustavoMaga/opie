* universal connectivity API that implements OBEX on top of
(wired or wireless) ethernet, infrared, and bluetooth:
Every host device has a number of interfaces which are
"connected" to certain peers. There are different kinds of
inquiry methods and connection states, however the basic
principle is the same. User level code that wants to send
an object to a peer could be greatly simplified that way.

* generic subsystem base classes to unify the
network, bluetooth, pcmcia, input, etc. APIs

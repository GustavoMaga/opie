<h1>Opie Console: Getting started</h1><br><p>

Opie Console is profile oriented. A "Profile" contains the
information necessary to connect to a remote host. For example
it determines which connection type, terminal type, font, color and more
to be used.<p><p>

To set up a connection you can either use a previously saved profile 
or choose to create a connection on the fly.<p><p>

To create a new connection, you can either go to "Connection" and select "New Connection",
or click the "New" Button (<img src="new.png" width="14" height="14">).
To use a previously saved profile, select "New from Profile" in the menu.<br><p>

After you clicked OK on the New Connection Dialog, or if you load a
previously saved profile, a new tab will be created in the main
window. Depending on your preference the connection will be automaticly
established or you need to connect by clicking on the "Connection" menu and
then "Connect". To disconnect, select "Disconnect".<br><p>

When you're done select "Close Window". This will close the the connection
and remove the widget from the main application view.<br><p>

If an application in the terminal hangs you may choose to terminate that
Connection<br><p>

Text which gets selected inside the Terminal Widget will be transparently copied 
to the clipboard, so you do not need to copy via a copy button.

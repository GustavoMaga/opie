For GCC 3 based system you should OpenEmbedded for building


For gcc 2.95 cross compiler:
Steps for building libetpan for arm-zaurus environment:

1. Get the sources from etpan-cvs with command

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.libetpan.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/libetpan co libetpan

when try to get the 0.33b release 
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.libetpan.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/libetpan co -r rel-0-33-b libetpan

2. export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/bin
3. cd into the libetpan sourcedir
4. run 
./configure --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux --disable-db --disable-debug

the disable-db is required!!!!
5. check the output of configure, you MUST find a line 
  "checking for openssl/ssl.h... yes" and
  "checking for SSL_library_init in -lssl... yes"

If not, you don't have SSL installed into your crosscompiling chain. Thats bad.
SSL is strongly needed!

6. Check the file Rules in top-srcdir. There is a line 
  "CFLAGS      =  -O2 -W -Wall -g  -DDEBUG -DHAVE_CONFIG_H"
  
  remove the -g option

For remote debugging this is not required, but the local copy must contain debug
code for that.

7. make, make install
  Now you should find libetpan in /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/lib

If you're using other pathes then you should give that of course instead of 2.95.3.

<h1>In- and Outbox</h1>
You can switch between the inbox and outbox by using the two tabs above the list view.
Each mail entry is shown with the mail sender, the mail subject and the seding date.<br>
A blue  icon <img src="../../../../pics/mailit/attach.png"></img> indicates whether this mail contains attachments.<br>
<b><i>Note:</i></b> Nested and alternative MIME attachments are not yet handled.<p>
Mail which is not yet downloaded is shown in <font color=red>red</font>, unread mail is indicated in <font color=blue>blue </font>.
<br>
Double clicking a mail opens it for reading.
Appearance and handling do apply for both inbox and outbox.

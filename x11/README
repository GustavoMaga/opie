We try hard to get Opie compiled with  Qt2/X11

While directly drawing into the framebuffer is fast
and takes less memory compared to Qt2/X11
sometimes you may want  to use X11 cause you need
some feature of the X protocol or you think it's just
cute.

We try hard to not break Opies normal compilation and to avoid
#ifdefs at all cost

Things that are different on X11 with Qt2/X11
- No fonthandling
- No Windowdecoration
- No IPC
- No keyhandling
- No powerhandling

are built in

We will ignore fontloading for now cause it belongs to X11.
The same applies to keyhandling
X11 is taking care of APM if not it's the kernel...

Ok so we need to replace IPC and do empty stubs for the other things

IPC: Our X11 IPC system is called OCOP and we've an almost sc QCopChannel
implementation. QCopEnvelope should work out of the box.
We do some symlinks to built opie out of the box.

How to build Opie/x11 currently it's quite hard to but I'll make it more easy
soon

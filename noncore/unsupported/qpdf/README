QPDF - a PDF viewer for the Qtopia environment

This tool is based on xpdf (currently 1.00). It uses the (mostly unmodified -
see below) xpdf PDF rendering engine. The Qtopia adaption was done with a new 
OutputDev which renders directly to a QPixmap via QPainter calls.

Changes in 20020406:
 - Font substitution handling improved.
 - Unknown characters are simply ignored now.
 - Fullscreen view added.
 
Changes in 20020407:
 - Crash with FontName == 0 fixed
 - Cleanup
 - Prepare for CVS import

Changes in 20020408:
 - Progress indicator added
 - Problems with type 3 fonts (not fully supported by XPDF) solved
 - Heavy optimizations in the image rendering code

Changed in 20020413:
 - Fixed crash in find routine
 - Stylus selection reworked
 - Cursor-key navigation added
 - Various crashes related to recursive calling of XPDF fixed 


Changes to xpdf:
 - xpdf calculates nearly everything with doubles. Since ARMs are not equipped
   with a FPU, all doubles have been replaced with a C++ class "fouble" (fixed
   double), which operates on 32bit integers with fixed point arithmetic.
   This gave a speedup of up to 800% for image rendering.
   
 - No Font handling anymore - This means no embedded, no true-type, no type1-
   fonts. The task to choose the right font is up to the Qt QFont class.
   This works pretty well -- only Symbol fonts give problems.
   
 - Everything that should be rotated (fonts, images) is simply ignored, because
   a) the Qtopia Qt/E config has QPainter transformations disabled
   b) the transformation is awful slow
   c) do you really need rotated images on your iPaq ? ;)

   
ToDo:
 - Clipping has been deactivated, because Qt/E had problems with QPainter
   save/restore's with active clipping regions. I need to investigate this
   in detail.
   
 - Links are currently simply ignored.

 
Install:
 - xpdf-1.00
   Get the tarball for xpdf, version 1.0, untar it and ./configure it.
   (No special flags are needed for ./configure - it simply has to run)
   
 - qpdf
   Make sure your QPEDIR / TMAKEPATH variables are correctly !
 
   cd into the xpdf directory (xpdf-1.00) and untar the qpdf tarball. This 
   should create a subdirectory qpdf.
   cd into this directory and start the script "./setup-qpdf". This 
   incorporates the above mentioned patches into xpdf.
   
   Now do a make.
   
   Copy the files qpdf, qpdf_icon.png and qpdf.desktop to the appropriate
   directories on your iPaq or:
   If you want a ipk, just run ./mkipkg

 - compress / uncompress
   If you run a normal familiar installation, it the standard gzip (I tested
   1.2.4-33 ipkg)  can handle the compression format used in PDF files, when 
   called as uncompress. The BusyBox version of gzip can _not_ handle this 
   old format.
   
   If you do not have a working uncompress installed on your iPaq, you can 
   simply use the one in the contrib directory of the tarball (make uncompress 
   a link to compress).
   [I could not find an official tarball for compress -- this is the SuSE
   version cross-compiled for ARM]
   
   
Have fun ;)

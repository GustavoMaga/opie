-Add XML Index ( dropped )
-Add ReadOnly Resources  ( to be discussed )
-Add Sorted/Random Access mode for faster access to the base ( to be discussed )

Yeah Stefan you're right I need to stop the fragmentation but these are just ideas
we not to talk about.

New Ideas Widgets:
    OCategoryPopup:
	Like the function Menu in Xemacs. If there are too many
	Categories sort them into sub popups. A-B,B-G,H-K....
	Integrate SUbcategories
	
	
New Ideas on Infrastructure:
    -finally switch to sqlite
    -rework Category Sub Categories
    -X-Ref!!!!!
    -signalling ( Peer to Peer/ Backend to Backend communication of changes on a file basis )
    -Signal the User about updates. Use QSignal and make it generic push from backend
	to the access.
    -flocking, mmapping
    -Generic Tablewidget, getting QString for a record and attribute ( generic ) like QProperty
    -chooser widgets
    -hierachies
    -multiple backends
    -public private sort public and private on backends. default backend for each if multiple
    backends loaded. Move from backend to backend.. ( backend mover app? )
    -importer/exporter
    -check if cache also drops
    -port to BigSize Api
    
    ORedoManager ORedoItem both are templates to allow undoing and redoing to a level...

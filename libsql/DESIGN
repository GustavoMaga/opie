Design of OpieSQL

My intention for OpieSQL was to write
a simple c++ interface which would allow
easy use of common database functions on
different backends

How does these goals reflect the current Implementation

-through OSQLManager + OSQLBackEnd I'll be able to change
the default db driver and be able to add new 
driver implementations

-OSQLQuery, RawQuery, SelectQuery allows a flexible and
OO way of fast querying databases

-much more ;)

opie-remote
===========

Opie-Remote is a universal infra-red remote control application for Opie on
handhelds such as the iPAQ and the Zaurus. It requires LIRC 
(http://www.lirc.org) to run. There are LIRC packages for the iPAQ in the 
Familiar feed. You must first install the kernel-module-lirc-sir package, 
and then the lirc package. OpenZaurus should provide similar packages.

Note that Opie-Remote has only been tested on an iPAQ h3800 series device.


Todo

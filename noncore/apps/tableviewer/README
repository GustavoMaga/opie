Table Viewer;

This application is still in development, very buggy and leaks memory like 
a sieve.  There are still a few major features/design work to be done.  Once
The app has settled (i.e. implementation of initial design completed) the 
focus will switch from features to making the code worthy of Trolltech.  
This means finding all the memory leaks, possibly some restructoring of code
for future maintainability and ensuring that the code is readable 
(reasonable names for classes and vars.)

For convenience there is a db.xml file included that is generated from the 
CIA World fact book, 11-May-01.  The current version of this file should always work with the current version of the tableviewer application 

Major design work yet to be completed

* ensure that only reasonable controls are enabled.
* implement delete item & delete keys
* loading dialogs
* filterview -> dialog
* only do sensible things if no keys set. includes;
	No list view,
	No filter view,
	No edit item.
* Tool bar in both 'views'
* only build widgets as needed
* click on scrollview to change key type, (remove key dialog)
* fix navigate buttons

This README will also be removed once the major design work is done.

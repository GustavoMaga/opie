/**
 * This class offers easy use of "auto-completion", "manual-completion" or
 * "shell completion" on QString objects. A common use is completing filenames
 * or URLs (see @ref OURLCompletion()).
 * But it is not limited to URL-completion -- everything should be completable!
 * The user should be able to complete email-addresses, telephone-numbers,
 * commands, SQL queries, ...
 * Every time your program knows what the user can type into an edit-field, you
 * should offer completion. With OCompletion, this is very easy, and if you are
 * using a line edit widget (@ref OLineEdit), it is even more easy.
 * Basically, you tell a OCompletion object what strings should be completable
 * and whenever completion should be invoked, you call @ref makeCompletion().
 * OLineEdit and (an editable) OComboBox even do this automatically for you.
 *
 * OCompletion offers the completed string via the signal @ref match() and
 * all matching strings (when the result is ambiguous) via the method
 * @ref allMatches().
 *
 * Notice: auto-completion, shell completion and manual completion work
 *         slightly differently:
 *
 * @li auto-completion always returns a complete item as match.
 *     When more than one matching items are available, it will deliver just
 *     the first (depending on sorting order) item. Iterating over all matches
 *     is possible via @ref nextMatch() and @ref previousMatch().
 *
 * @li popup-completion works in the same way, the only difference being that
 *     the completed items are not put into the edit-widget, but into a
 *     separate popup-box.
 *
 * @li manual completion works the same way as auto-completion, the
 *     subtle difference is, that it isn't invoked automatically while the user
 *     is typing, but only when the user presses a special key. The difference
 *     of manual and auto-completion is therefore only visible in UI classes,
 *     OCompletion needs to know whether to deliver partial matches
 *     (shell completion) or whole matches (auto/manual completion), therefore
 *     @ref OGlobalSettings::CompletionMan and
 *     @ref OGlobalSettings::CompletionAuto have the exact same effect in
 *     OCompletion.
 *
 * @li shell completion works like how shells complete filenames:
 *     when multiple matches are available, the longest possible string of all
 *     matches is returned (i.e. only a partial item).
 *     Iterating over all matching items (complete, not partial) is possible
 *     via @ref nextMatch() and @ref previousMatch().
 *
 * You don't have to worry much about that though, OCompletion handles
 * that for you, according to the setting @ref setCompletionMode().
 * The default setting is globally configured by the user and read
 * from @ref OGlobalSettings::completionMode().
 *
 * A short example:
 * <pre>
 * OCompletion completion;
 * completion.setOrder( OCompletion::Sorted );
 * completion.addItem( "pfeiffer@kde.org" );
 * completion.addItem( "coolo@kde.org" );
 * completion.addItem( "carpdjih@sp.zrz.tu-berlin.de" );
 * completion.addItem( "carp@cs.tu-berlin.de" );
 *
 * cout << completion.makeCompletion( "ca" ).latin1() << endl;
 * </pre>
 * In shell-completion-mode, this will be "carp"; in auto-completion-
 * mode it will be "carp@cs.tu-berlin.de", as that is alphabetically
 * smaller.
 * If setOrder was set to Insertion, "carpdjih@sp.zrz.tu-berlin.de"
 * would be completed in auto-completion-mode, as that was inserted before
 * "carp@cs.tu-berlin.de".
 *
 * You can dynamically update the completable items by removing and adding them
 * whenever you want.
 * For advanced usage, you could even use multiple OCompletion objects. E.g.
 * imagine an editor like kwrite with multiple open files. You could store
 * items of each file in a different OCompletion object, so that you know (and
 * tell the user) where a completion comes from.
 *
 * Note: OCompletion does not work with strings that contain 0x0 characters
 *       (unicode nul), as this is used internally as a delimiter.
 *
 * You may inherit from OCompletion and override @ref makeCompletion() in
 * special cases (like reading directories/urls and then supplying the
 * contents to OCompletion, as OURLCompletion does), but generally, this is
 * not necessary.

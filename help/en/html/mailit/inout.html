<h1>In- and Outbox</h1>
You can switch between the inbox and outbox by using the two tabs above the list view.
Each mail entry is shown with the mail sender, the mail subject and the sending date.<br>
A blue  icon <img src="../../../../pics/mailit/attach.png"></img> indicates whether this mail contains attachments.<br>
<b><i>Note:</i></b> Nested and alternative MIME attachments are not yet handled.<p>
Mail which is not yet downloaded is shown in <font color=red>red</font>, unread mail is indicated in <font color=blue>blue </font>.
<br>
Double clicking a mail opens it for reading. If the mail is not yet donwloaded (due to reaching the size limit), a dialog is shown to ask you whether you would like to do it now.
Appearance and handling do apply for both inbox and outbox.

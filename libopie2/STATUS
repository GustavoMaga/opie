March 2003 - Initial checkin into the Opie CVS:
==================================================================

So, this is what I have been working on over the last months.
It's a part of what I think could migrate into our next generation
opielibs.
Of course this won't happen after we released Opie 1.0 and switched
to Qt3-Embedded and gcc 3.

Right now, there is content only in opiecore, opienet and opieui.
A good part of code has been adapted from the kdelibs, which overall
are pretty good however in details of heterogenous quality. I'm also
not sure if all I ported should be kept, e.g. the pixmapeffect stuff
seems unnecesary to me. However, we should not forget that Opie will
make its debut on more powerful devices with greater display
resolution, e.g. the Sharp C700, so we shouldn't limit ourselves in
what should go into the libraries.

Generally spoken, a lot of things are still very rough and messy,
but I will keep improving this. Some details about what is usable
and what is not follows:
(everything compiles of course, otherwise I wouldn't have checked in :-)

[-----------]
[ opiecore ]
[-----------]
oapplication, oconfig, oglobal seem to be usable yet, oglobalsettings
is still very messy and should be revised. A lot more thinking about how
we should keep opie preferences, especially when moving to multi-user, has to be made.
This will affect what goes into oglobalsettings and what configuration data
format we will use. If we switch to Qt3 we will have to decide if we stay
with OConfig deriving from Config or rewrite it using QSettings.

[-----------]
[  opiedb  ]
[-----------]
There is nothing here yet. The sqlite stuff should be here.

[-----------]
[ opienet ]
[-----------]
onetwork*, omonitoring* and the opacket stuff are pretty usable and not
very far from being complete. documentation for these will come...
Over the next days, opie-wellenreiter, opie-wirelessapplet and the
forthcoming new opie-networkapplet will be using the
new network classes.
I think all the other network libraries spread throught opie, e.g.
libbend, libmail, ftplib should be revised and become part of
opienet eventually.

[-----------]
[ opiepim ]
[-----------]
Nothing here yet. The stuff currently in libopie/pim should be here.

[-----------]
[ opieui ]
[-----------]
Pretty messy yet, but some things are usable. Unfortunately, the UI
stuff is very hard to backport to Qt2, so some things only work
if compiled against Qt3, especially all the popupcompletion stuff.
OListView however works nice and is currently used in opie-wellenreiter.

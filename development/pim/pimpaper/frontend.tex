\subsection{Low Level Frontend}
For general (typeless) operations, OPimBase provides a real low level, reference based, interface, for basic queries
and record finding. These operations are common to all frontends.

\subsection{OTemplateBase}
Inherited from OPimBase and implements bits \comment{bits? Teile ? Welche Teile ? Sollte es nicht eher vervollständigen heissen?} of the OPimBase Interface.
This class is present to be used by the Backends ( OPimAccessBackend )
to set cache sizes and to cache items.

\subsection{OPimAccessTemplate}
Implements OTemplateBase and OPimBase. All low level functions are
automatically implemented by the OPimAccessTemplate which does
additional type checking, based on OPimRecord::rtti.\\
This template is value based and utilizes the backend. The backend
can be set on instancing by the constructor. If no backend is specified,
the default implementation will be used (which one is defined by the config file
pimaccess.conf).
This AccessTemplate operates on types, based on OPimRecord and is meant
to be used by concrete frontend implementations for todo, datebook-event,
note and contact. The concrete frontends can be used by applications.
Use this template to create new PIM types.

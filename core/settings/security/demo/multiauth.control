Description: multi-plugin authentication demonstrator for Opie.
 This demonstration application allows us to use one or several
 ways to lock and unlock our device. Since it really locks your
 PDA the way you configured it in the Security settings, you can
 map a button to it through the Buttons settings to lock your
 PDA on demand, with one simple click.
 You must install some opie-multiauth-* plugins, and configure
 them through opie-security, to really see its possibilities.

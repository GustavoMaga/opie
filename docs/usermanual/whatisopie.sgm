<chapter><title>What is &opie;?</title>
<para>
&opie; is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the Linux operating system (and
might work on other OSes as well).  It was originally designed for handheld
computers (such as the Compaq/HP iPAQ and the Sharp Zaurus), but could
probably function well in other environments requiring a light GUI, such as an
old laptop, or an internet kiosk.  It is based upon &qt;/Embedded from Trolltech,
which is in turn a graphical environment designed for embedded applications,
based upon the &qt; toolkit.

<para>
&opie; has been designed for devices with small screens, and a touchscreen input
device (ie, only one mouse click, and no constant mouse position), as well as
designed to fit in a relatively small amount of storage space (about 5 megabytes
for the base libraries and the launcher).

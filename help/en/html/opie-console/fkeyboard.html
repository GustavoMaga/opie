<h1>Keyboard Values</h1>
Q Keycodes are for mostly special keys that do not actually have a text value
but do some action. For example the F1 ~ F12 keys, Page Up, Page Down and so
on. Unicode value is for your normal keys like 'A', Space, and any other value
that you can see on the screen.

Q Keycodes are in qnamespace.h, but must be converted to decimal. Here are a few of the
most important values.<p>

Escape = 4096<br>
Backspace = 4099<br>
Return = 4100<br>
Enter = 4101<br>
Insert = 4102<br>
Delete = 4103<br>
Home = 4112<br>

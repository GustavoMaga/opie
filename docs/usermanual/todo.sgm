<chapter><title>Todo</title>
<para>
Todo is designed for storing information about things you need to do, but which
arent going to happen at a specific time, like "change the oil" or "mow the
lawn". You can also give todo items a deadline, if they have to be completed by
a certain time.

<section><title>Adding Tasks</title>
<para>
Go to <GUIMenu>Data</GUIMenu>&arrow;<GUIMenuItem>New Task<GUIMenuItem>, or click
on the new task icon (blank page). The priority drop down menu lets you select
the priority of the task. The lower the number, the more important it is. The
categories behave in much the same way that they do in Calendar, you can select
the category from the drop down menu, or you can click the "..." button to add,
delete, or edit categories. To give the task a due date, check the "Due"
checkbox, and then click the button next to it (it should contain the current
date). That will open a calendar from which you can select the due date. The
"Completed" check box is the same as the checkbox next to each item in the main
view. The "Summary" field is for a short summary that will be visible in the
main view, as well as in the Today application.  The down arrow next to it will
copy the text in the "Summary" field into the large text field below it, which
is used for a more detailed description of the task.  Click "ok" in the upper
right to add the new task, or "x" to close the window without adding the new
task.

dialog should apear as if you were adding a task, but the information for that
task should already be filled in. You can change any of it you want to, and then
click "ok" in the top right corner to save the changes, or "x" to go back to
the way it was.

<section><title>Finding Tasks</title>
<para>
To find a task, either go to
<GUIMenu>Options</GUIMenu>&arrow;<GUIMenuItem>Find</GUIMenuItem>
, or click the find icon (an image of a green magnifying glass), and a dialog
should pop up. Enter the text you want to search for in the description, and
select the category that you want it to search through (this will speed the
search up, if you know what category it is in). You can also select "case
sensative" which makes the search pay attention to the case of what you type (so
if you look for "mow lawn", it won't find a task called "Mow lawn"). "Search
Backwards" will search backwards from the currently selected task. Click "Find"
to initiate the search, when it finds a task that matches the string, it will
select it. If you click Find again, it will find the next one in the list (or
the previous one, if "Search backwards" is selected).

check box in the edit dialog. If <GUIMenu>Options</GUIMenu>&arrow;
<GUIMenuItem>Completed<GUIMenuItem> tasks is not checked, the task will
disapear when you mark it completed. but do not worry, it is not gone forever,
just check Completed tasks in the options menu, and you can see and edit it 
again.

      <source>&lt;b>The Rules&lt;/b>&lt;p>kBill has been painstakingly designed and researched in order to make it as easy to use for the whole family as it is for little Sally. Years - nay - days of beta testing and consulting with the cheapest of human interface designers have resulted in a game that is easy to use, yet nothing at all like a Macintosh.&lt;p>&lt;UL>&lt;LI>Whack the Bills (click)&lt;/LI>&lt;LI>Restart the computer (click)&lt;/LI>&lt;LI>Pick up stolen OSes &amp; return (drag) them to their respective computers&lt;/LI>&lt;LI>Drag the bucket to extinguish sparks&lt;/LI>&lt;LI>Scoring is based on total uptime, with bonuses for killing Bills.&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>&lt;P>As for the rest, you can probably work it out for yourself.  We did, so it can't be too hard</source>

      <source>&lt;b>The Story&lt;/b>&lt;p>Yet again, the fate of the world rests in your hands!  An evil computer hacker, known only by his handle 'Bill', has created the ultimate computer virus.  A virus so powerful that it has the power to transmute an ordinary computer into a toaster oven.  (oooh!) 'Bill' has cloned himself into a billion-jillion micro-Bills.  Their sole purpose is to deliver the nefarious virus, which has been cleverly disguised as a popular operating system. As System Administrator and Exterminator, your job is to keep Bill from succeeding at his task.</source>

Steps for building libetpan for arm-zaurus environment:
1. export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/bin
2. cd into the libetpan sourcedir
3. run 
./configure --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux --disable-db --disable-debug

the disable-db is required!!!!
4. check the output of configure, you MUST find a line 
  "checking for openssl/ssl.h... yes" and
  "checking for SSL_library_init in -lssl... yes"

If not, you don't have SSL installed into your crosscompiling chain. Thats bad.
SSL is strongly needed!

5. Check the file Rules in top-srcdir. There is a line 
  "CFLAGS      =  -O2 -W -Wall -g  -DDEBUG -DHAVE_CONFIG_H"
  
  remove the -g option

For remote debugging this is not required, but the local copy must contain debug
code for that.

6. make, make install
  Now you should find libetpan in /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/lib

If you're using other pathes then you should give that of course instead of 2.95.3.
